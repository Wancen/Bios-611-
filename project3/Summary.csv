" Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry","Injectable Bioresponsive Gel Depot for Enhanced Immune Checkpoint Blockade.","Although cancer immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors holds greatpromise toward many types of cancers, several challenges still remain, associatedwith low objective response of patient rate as well as systemic side effects.Here, a combination immunotherapy strategy is developed based on a thermogellingreactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polypeptide gel for sustained release ofanti-programmed cell death-ligand  antibody and dextro--methyl tryptophan,inhibitor of indoleamine-,-dioxygenase with leveraging the ROS level in thetumor microenvironment. This bioresponsive gel depot can effectively reduce thelocal ROS level and facilitate release of immunotherapeutics, which leads toenhanced anti-melanoma efficacy in vivo."

Less is known about how family history of breastcancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.METHODS: The Sister Study is a cohort of , women who had a sister withbreast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported allrecreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered inassociation with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and % confidenceintervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporatingcharacteristics of the family structure.RESULTS: During follow-up (average . years), , cases were diagnosed. Higherhours/week (HR>=vs<=.; %CI: .-.) and MET-hours/week(HRquartilevs=.; %CI: .-.) of physical activity were associated withreduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Hours/week and MET-hours/week wereassociated with suggestive increased premenopausal breast cancer risk(MET-hours/week HRquartilevs=.; %CI: .-.). Associations did not varywith extent of family history. However, the increased risk in premenopausal womenmay be limited to those with stronger family history.CONCLUSIONS: In women with a family history of breast cancer, physical activitywas associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, breast cancerrisk and was not modified by extent of family history.IMPACT: This was the first study to examine the association between physicalactivity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family history ofbreast cancer."

" Ponce Health Sciences University","Effects of histone methyltransferase inhibition in endometriosis.","Although the histone methyltransferase EZH and its product HKme are wellstudied in cancer, little is known about their role and potential as therapeutictargets in endometriosis. We have previously reported that endometriotic lesionsare characterized by global enrichment of HKme. Therefore, we aimed to ()characterize the expression levels of EZH in endometriotic tissues; () assessHKme enrichment in candidate genes promoter regions; and () determine ifpharmacological inhibition of EZH impacts migration, proliferation, and invasionof endometriotic cells. Immunohistochemistry of an endometriosis-focused tissuemicroarray was used to assess the EZH protein levels in tissues. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation-qPCR was conducted to assess enrichment of HKme incandidate gene promoter regions in tissues. Immunofluorescence was performed toassess the effect of an EZH-specific pharmacological inhibitor on HKmeglobal enrichment in cell lines. To measure effects of the inhibitor inmigration, proliferation, and invasion in vitro we used Scratch, BrdU, andMatrigel assays, respectively. Endometriotic lesions had significantly higherEZHÎ± nuclear immunostaining levels compared to eutopic endometrium from patients(glands, stroma) and controls (glands). HKme was enriched within promoterregions of candidate genes in some but not all of the endometriotic lesions.Inhibition of EZH reduced HKme levels in the endometriotic cellsspecifically, and also reduced migration, proliferation but not invasion ofendometriotic epithelial cells (Z). These findings support future preclinicalstudies to determine in vivo efficacy of EZH inhibitors as promising nonhormonaltreatments for endometriosis, still an incurable gynecological disease."

The nanocapsule consists of a drug-silica complexfilling and a solid silica sheath, and it is designed to minimally release drugmolecules in the early hours of cell entry. While taken up by macrophages at highrates, the nanocapsules minimally affect cell migration in the first - h,buying time for macrophages to home to tumors and release drugs in situ.

Restricting to women with at least % stromal area(Nâ=â), epithelial nuclear density decreased with age (-. cells/mm perdecade of life after age , pâ<â.), increased with mammographic density(. cells/mm per increasing BI-RADs density category pâ=â.), andincreased non-significantly with recent parity, later age at first pregnancy, andlonger and more recent oral contraceptive use. These associations were attenuatedin women with mostly fat samples (<% stroma (Nâ=â)). Thirty-one percent ofwomen evaluated had both adequate stroma (â¥%) and mostly fat (<% stroma)regions of breast tissue, with the probability of having both types increasingwith the number breast tissue samplings. Several breast cancer risk factors areassociated with elevated age-related epithelial content, but associations dependupon stromal context. Stromal characteristics appear to modify relationshipsbetween risk factor exposures and breast epithelial involution."

"Academic Medical Center","Extracellular vesicles exposing tissue factor for the prediction of venousthromboembolism in patients with cancer: A prospective cohort study.","INTRODUCTION: The procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles (EV) exposingtissue factor (TF) is a promising biomarker for venous thromboembolism (VTE) incancer patients. We evaluated an in-house EV-TF activity assay (the fibringeneration test) for the prediction of cancer-associated VTE. We also comparedthe results with the fibrin generation tests to an EV-TF-dependent factor Xageneration assay in samples from pancreatic cancer patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collected in a multinational, prospective cohortstudy were used. Patients with various types of advanced cancer were enrolled ifchemotherapy was scheduled or started in the previous â¯months. Patients werefollowed for â¯months for the occurrence of VTE. The fibrin generation test wasperformed at baseline to measure EV-TF procoagulant activity.RESULTS: The fibrin generation test was performed in  patients with advancedcancer. The mean age was â¯years; % had distant metastasis. Forty patients(.%) developed VTE. Overall, a high fibrin generation test result wasassociated with a two-fold increased risk for VTE (HR .; %-CI, .-.). Theassociation was stronger in patients with pancreatic cancer (HR .; %-CI,.-) than in those with other tumor types (HR .; %-CI, .-.).Correlation between the FGT and the TF-dependent factor Xa generation assay inpatients with pancreatic cancer was poor (Spearman's Râ¯=â¯.).CONCLUSION: This study shows that a high EV-TF procoagulant activity as measuredby the fibrin generation test is associated with an increased risk of VTE incancer patients, in particular in those with pancreatic cancer.

" University of Liverpool","Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of humanTribbles  (TRIB) pseudokinase in cancer cells.","A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis ofpseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with whichto probe function. Tribbles  (TRIB) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with adiverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There issubstantial evidence that human TRIB promotes survival and drug resistance insolid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutictarget. The unusual TRIB pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-richC-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminaltail, which also supports its interaction with E ubiquitin ligases. We foundthat TRIB is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinaseinhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinasedomains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Usinga thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB-binding compounds within the PublishedKinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classifycompounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB in vitro. TRIBdestabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIBdegradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signalingand survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development ofTRIB-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling thecellular mechanisms of TRIB-based signaling. Our study highlights that smallmolecule-induced protein down-regulation through drug ""off-targets"" might berelevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases."

"University of Glasgow","Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of humanTribbles  (TRIB) pseudokinase in cancer cells.","A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis ofpseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with whichto probe function. Tribbles  (TRIB) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with adiverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There issubstantial evidence that human TRIB promotes survival and drug resistance insolid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutictarget. The unusual TRIB pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-richC-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminaltail, which also supports its interaction with E ubiquitin ligases. We foundthat TRIB is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinaseinhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinasedomains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Usinga thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB-binding compounds within the PublishedKinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classifycompounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB in vitro. TRIBdestabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIBdegradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signalingand survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development ofTRIB-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling thecellular mechanisms of TRIB-based signaling.

We show that, independent of ligand,AR-V binds both androgen-responsive elements (AREs) and non-canonical sitesdistinct from full-length AR (AR-FL) targets. Consequently, AR-V not onlyrecapitulates AR-FL's partial functions but also regulates an additional geneexpression program uniquely via binding to gene promoters rather than AREenhancers. AR-V binding and AR-V-mediated activation at these unique targets donot require FOXA but rely on ZFX and BRD. Knockdown of ZFX or select uniquetargets of AR-V/ZFX, or BRD inhibition, suppresses growth ofcastration-resistant prostate cancer cells. We also define an AR-V direct targetgene signature that correlatesÂ with AR-V expression in primary tumors,differentiates metastatic prostate cancer from normal, and predicts poorprognosis. Thus, AR-V has both ARE/FOXA canonical and ZFX-directednon-canonical regulatory functions in the evolution of anti-androgen therapeuticresistance, providing information to guide effective therapeutic strategies."

" Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School","Classifying medical histories in US Medicare beneficiaries using fixed vsall-available look-back approaches.","PURPOSE: Evaluate use of fixed and all-available look-backs to identifyeligibility criteria and confounders among Medicare beneficiaries.METHODS: We identified outpatient visits (-) with recently documented(â¤Â days) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether theexposure (statin) was initiated within Â days. We selected each beneficiary'sfirst eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during therespective look-backs: continuous enrollment ( or Â years for fixed look-back;Â days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. Weestimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (HRs) forthe effect of statin initiation on incident -month cancer (a known null effect)and -year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using eachlook-back.RESULTS: Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated HR from the all-availableapproach (HRÂ =Â ., % CI: ., .) was less biased than the -yearlook-back (HRÂ =Â ., % CI: ., .), which included beneficiaries withprevalent cancer. The -year look-back (HRÂ =Â ., % CI: ., .) wassomewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due theexclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuousenrollment (.% and .% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). Allapproaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality.Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding.CONCLUSIONS: The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the -yearfixed, which produced the least biased point estimate.

We sought to characterise the prevalence and correlates of theincorrect belief that VLNC cigarettes are less carcinogenic than currentcigarettes, as this could reduce motivation to quit.METHODS: Participants were a nationally representative sample of  adultsmokers in the USA. In -, before the VLNC proposal became public, thesesmokers took part in an online survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses tocalculate ORs and percentages and a Ï test to examine the association betweenvariables.RESULTS: Overall, .% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. Thismisperception was more common among smokers who were aged above  (.%) andblack (.%). Additionally, .% of smokers reported they would be less likelyto quit if the USA adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes wouldbe less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be lesslikely to quit (P<.).CONCLUSIONS: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking VLNC cigarettes isless likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would be less likely toquit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a communicationcampaign that emphasises the continued dangers of smoking VLNC cigarettes due tothe many toxic chemicals in smoke."

Serum cholesterol was positively correlated with prostate weight(pâ=â.) and tumor epithelial proliferation (pâ=â.), and negativelycorrelated with tumor epithelial apoptosis (pâ=â.). Serum cholesterol wasunrelated to body weight (pâ=â.). Tumor stromal cell proliferation wasreduced in the ezetimibe group (pâ=â.). Increased serum cholesterol at months was associated with elevated intraprostatic DHEA, testosterone, andandrostenedione (pâ=â., pâ=â., pâ=â., respectively). However,cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect adenocarcinoma development at, , or  months of age (, , and % in ezetimibe-treated vs. , , and% in mice not receiving ezetimibe).CONCLUSIONS: Though serum cholesterol reduction did not significantly affect therate of adenocarcinoma development in the PTEN-null transgenic mouse model ofprostate cancer, it lowered intraprostatic androgens and slowed tumor growth.These findings support a role for serum cholesterol in promoting prostate cancergrowth, potentially via enhanced tumor androgen signaling, and may provide newinsight into cholesterol-lowering interventions for prostate cancer treatment."
" China Pharmaceutical University","Immune lipoprotein nanostructures inspired relay drug delivery for amplifyingantitumor efficiency.","Chemo-immunotherapy represents an appealing approach to improving cancertreatment. Simultaneously administrating chemotherapeutics with immunoadjuvantscan elicit potent tumor death and immune responses. Herein, high densitylipoprotein (HDL) inspired immune lipoprotein was proposed for relay drugdelivery and amplifying antitumor therapy. Lipophilic ASaptamer-immunoadjuvant CpG fused sequences (Apt-CpG-DSPE) were conjugated tofacilitate decoration onto HDLs; and doxorubicin (Dox) was successivelyintercalated into the consecutive base pairs of Apt-CpG to complete immune HDLnanodrug imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox. For relay drug delivery, imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox underwentsite-specific structure collapse in tumor intercellular substances inspired fromHDL biofunctions (sequential module I); subsequently, dissociated Apt-CpG-Dox wasendocytosed into tumor cells mediated by the recognition of AS and nucleolin(sequential module II), translocating Dox to nucleus and enabling tumor ablationand antigens release. The liberated CpG motif further evoked antigen recognition,induced vast secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated hostantitumor immunity. Our studies demonstrated that HDL biomimetic platform basedrelay drug delivery strategy outperformed the monotherapy counterparts inmalignant tumor models, eventually generating an augmented antitumor efficacy."
" and RTI International","Strategies for Successful Survivorship Care Plan Implementation: Results From aQualitative Study.","INTRODUCTION: Care for US cancer survivors is often fragmented, contributing topoor health outcomes. Care and outcomes may improve when survivors and follow-upcare providers receive survivorship care plans (SCPs), written documentscontaining information regarding cancer diagnosis, treatment, surveillance plans,and health promotion. However, implementing SCPs is challenging. As such, wesought to identify strategies for successfully implementing SCPs.METHODS: We measured SCP implementation using performance data from cancerprograms participating in the American Society of Clinical Oncology QualityOncology Practice Initiative, an oncologist-led quality assessment andimprovement program. We used semistructured interviews with cancer programemployees (eg, physicians) to identify strategies for successfully implementingSCPs by comparing approaches in cancer programs that, according to QualityOncology Practice Initiative performance indicators, developed and delivered SCPsto a relatively small proportion of eligible survivors and their follow-up careproviders (ie, low performers; n =  participants in five programs) withapproaches among programs with better performance (ie, moderate performers; n = participants in nine programs).RESULTS: Ten of  cancer programs developed SCPs for â¥ % of eligiblesurvivors; two of  delivered SCPs to any survivors; and eight of  deliveredSCPs to â¥ % of follow-up care providers. We found that moderate performersproactively addressed SCP requirements, leveraged requirements to improvesurvivorship care, set internal targets, automated implementation, had activeleaders and champions, and tasked appropriate employees with SCP implementation.CONCLUSION: SCP implementation remains challenging. We identified strategies forsuccessfully implementing SCPs. Future research should examine how cancerprograms have achieved these strategies; findings could contribute to anunderstanding of the changes needed to implement comprehensive survivorship care."

Despite the intenseresearch efforts in developing new nanoparticles and surface bonding ligands, onemajor obstacle in achieving highly effective treatment, including minimizingdetrimental side effects, is the inability to deliver drug-carrying nanoparticlesfrom the injection point directly to the tumor site. The present study seeks toemploy a direct nanodrug delivery methodology to feed multifunctionalnanoparticles directly to tumor vasculatures, sparing healthy tissue. Animportant aspect to examine is how the interactions between such nanoparticlesand relatively large red blood cells would affect the transport and deliveryefficiency of nanodrugs. So, a novel computer simulation model has been developedto study nanoparticle transport in a representative human hepatic artery system,subject to shear-induced diffusion of nanoparticles due to hydrodynamicinteractions with red blood cells. The particle-size effect was also evaluated bycomparing the dynamics of nanoparticles with microspheres. Results from computersimulations under physiologically realistic conditions indicate thatshear-induced diffusion has a significant effect on nanoparticle transport, evenin large arteries. Nevertheless, as documented, direct nanodrug delivery totumor-feeding hepatic artery branches is feasible.

" Wake Forest University School of Medicine","P-glycoprotein targeted and near-infrared light-guided depletion ofchemoresistant tumors.","Drug resistance remains a formidable challenge to cancer therapy. P-glycoprotein(Pgp) contributes to multidrug resistance in numerous cancers by preventingaccumulation of anticancer drugs in cancer cells. Strategies to overcome thisresistance have been vigorously sought for over  decades, yet clinical solutionsdo not exist. The main reason for the failure is lack of cancer specificity ofsmall-molecule Pgp inhibitors, thus causing severe toxicity in normal tissues. Inthis study, Pgp-targeted photodynamic therapy (PDT) was developed to achievesuperior cancer specificity through antibody targeting plus locoregional lightactivation. Thus, a Pgp monoclonal antibody was chemically modified with IR, aporphyrin photosensitizer. In vitro studies showed that theantibody-photosensitizer conjugates specifically bind to Pgp-expressing drugresistant cancer cells, and caused dramatic cytotoxicity upon irradiation with anear infrared light. We then tested our Pgp-targeted approach in mouse xenograftmodels of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In both models,targeted PDT produced rapid tumor shrinkage, and significantly prolonged survivalof tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that our targeted PDT approach producesmolecularly targeted and spatially selective ablation of chemoresistant tumors,and thereby provides an effective approach to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrugresistance in cancer, where conventional approaches have failed."

" Trinity College Dublin","The pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue: current controversies.","Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating cancer symptoms, and isassociated with impaired quality of life. The exact pathophysiology ofcancer-related fatigue (CRF) is poorly understood, but in any individual, it islikely multifactorial and involves inter-related cytokine, muscular,neurotransmitter, and neuroendocrine changes. Underlying CRF mechanisms proposedinclude central and peripheral hypotheses. Central mechanisms include hypothesesabout cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis disruption,circadian rhythm disruption, serotonin, and vagal afferent nerve function whileperipheral mechanisms include hypotheses about adenosine triphosphate and musclecontractile properties. Currently, these hypotheses are largely based on evidencefrom other conditions in which fatigue is characteristic. The purpose of thisarticle is to provide a narrative review of the literature and present thecurrent controversies in the pathophysiology of CRF, particularly in relation tocentral and peripheral hypotheses for CRF. An understanding of pathophysiologymay facilitate direct and simple therapeutic interventions for those with cancer."

Therefore, theextraction of cfDNA from a variety of clinical samples can be an effective andminimally invasive source of markers for disease detection and subsequentmanagement. In the oncological diseases, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), a cfDNAsub-class, can carry clinically actionable mutations and coupled with nextgeneration sequencing or other mutation detection methods provide a venue foreffective in vitro diagnostics. However, cfDNA mutational analyses require highquality inputs. This necessitates extraction platforms that provide high recoveryover the entire ctDNA size range ( â  bp) with minimal interferences (i.e.,co-extraction of genomic DNA), and high reproducibility with a simple workflow.Herein, we present a novel microfluidic solid-phase extraction device (Î¼SPE)consisting of a plastic chip that is activated with UV/O to generatesurface-confined carboxylic acid functionalities for the Î¼SPE of cfDNA. The Î¼SPEuses an immobilization buffer (IB) consisting of polyethylene glycol and saltsthat induce cfDNA condensation onto the activated plastic microfluidic surface.The Î¼SPE consists of an array of micropillars to increase extraction bed load(scalable to loads > ng of cfDNA) and can be produced at low-cost usingreplication-based techniques.

KSHV haslatent and lytic phases of the viral life cycle, and while both contribute toviral pathogenesis, lytic proteins contribute to KSHV-mediated oncogenesis.Reactivation from latency is driven by the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA,and RTA transcription is controlled by epigenetic modifications. To identify hostchromatin-modifying proteins that are involved in the latent to lytic transition,we screened a panel of inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins fortheir ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. We found several novel regulatorsof viral reactivation: an inhibitor of Bmi, PTC-, two additional histonedeacetylase inhibitors, Romidepsin and Panobinostat, and the bromodomaininhibitor (+)-JQ. All of these compounds stimulate lytic gene expression, viralgenome replication, and release of infectious virions. Treatment with Romidepsin,Panobinostat, and PTC- induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter, andresults in nucleosome depletion at this locus. Finally, silencing Bmi inducesKSHV reactivation, indicating that Bmi, a member of the Polycomb repressivecomplex , is critical for maintaining KSHV latency."

" University of Washington","Patient-centered prioritization of bladder cancer research.","BACKGROUND: Patient-centered research requires the meaningful involvement ofpatients and caregivers throughout the research process. The objective of thisstudy was to create a process for sustainable engagement for researchprioritization within oncology.METHODS: From December  to , a network of engaged patients for researchprioritization was created in partnership with the Bladder Cancer AdvocacyNetwork (BCAN): the BCAN Patient Survey Network (PSN). The PSN leveraged anonline bladder cancer community with additional recruitment through printadvertisements and social media campaigns. Prioritized research questions weredeveloped through a modified Delphi process and were iterated throughmultidisciplinary working groups and a repeat survey.RESULTS: In year  of the PSN,  patients and caregivers responded to theresearch prioritization survey; the number of responses increased to  in year. The majority of respondents had non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),and the mean time since diagnosis was  years. Stakeholder-identified questionsfor noninvasive, invasive, and metastatic disease were prioritized by the PSN.Free-text questions were sorted with thematic mapping. Several questionssubmitted by respondents were among the prioritized research questions. A finalprioritized list of research questions was disseminated to various fundingagencies, and a highly ranked NMIBC research question was included as a priorityarea in the  Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute announcement ofpragmatic trial funding.CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement is needed to identify high-priority researchquestions in oncology. The BCAN PSN provides a successful example of anengagement infrastructure for annual research prioritization in bladder cancer.The creation of an engagement network sets the groundwork for additional phasesof engagement, including design, conduct, and dissemination.

" Virginia Commonwealth University","Role of Age, Tumor Grade, and Radiation Therapy on Immediate PostmastectomyBreast Reconstruction.","BACKGROUND: Despite the psychological benefits and oncologic safety ofpostmastectomy breast reconstruction, most breast cancer patients do not undergoreconstruction. To better understand the patterns of breast reconstruction usage,it is important to identify the clinicopathologic factors associated withimmediate breast reconstruction (IBR), and whether modification of thereconstruction incidence when stratified by patient- or cancer-related factorsexists in the breast cancer population. The primary objectives were to determinewhether the incidence of immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction variesacross age, and whether the tumor grade or radiation therapy modify the effect ofage on the incidence of immediate breast reconstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsdatabase, we identified women who had undergone mastectomy for breast cancer from to . Inverse probability of treatment-weighted log-binomial regressionwas used to estimate the effect of age on IBR after accounting for potentialconfounding by patient demographic data and cancer characteristics. Potentialeffect measure modification by tumor grade and radiation therapy on the age-IBRrelationship was also assessed.RESULTS: Of , women, , (.%) had undergone IBR. Age wassignificantly associated with IBR prevalence (PÂ < .), with younger women morelikely to undergo IBR. Both tumor grade (PÂ < .) and radiation therapy (PÂ <.) modified the effect of age on IBR.CONCLUSION: Compared with their older counterparts, younger breast cancerpatients were more likely to undergo IBR, and both tumor grade and radiationtherapy were differentially associated with the likelihood of IBR across patientage."

" Zhejiang University ","Enzyme-Responsive Charge-Reversal Polymer-Mediated Effective Gene Therapy forIntraperitoneal Tumors.","Gene therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in many genetic diseases, asevidenced by recent clinical applications. Viral vectors have been extensivelytested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationicpolymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfectionefficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easilytailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drivegreat efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asksif nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can findapplication niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{N-[-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride}(PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side withchemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed byintracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicityand fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA(PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to makeserum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In anintraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervicalcancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumorinhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gavemuch less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapydrugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed muchfewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviralvectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantagesand may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example,intraperitoneal cancer therapy."
" University of Chicago","PAM and Risk of Recurrence Scores for Interval Breast Cancers.","Breast cancers detected after a negative breast screening examination and priorto the next screening are referred to as interval cancers. These cancersgenerally have poor clinical characteristics compared with screen-detectedcancers, but associations between interval cancer and genomic cancercharacteristics are not well understood. Mammographically screened womendiagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from  to  (n = ) wereidentified by linking the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and the CarolinaMammography Registry. Among women with a registry-identified screening mammogram to  months before diagnosis, cancers were classified as screen-detected (N =) or interval-detected (N = ). Using logistic regression, we examined theassociation of mode of detection with cancer characteristics (clinical, IHC, andgenomic), overall, and in analyses stratified on mammographic density and race.Interval cancer was associated with large tumors [> cm; OR, .; % confidenceinterval (CI), .-.], positive nodal status (OR, .; % CI, .-.), andtriple-negative subtype (OR, .; % CI, .-.). Interval cancers were morelikely to have non-Luminal A subtype (OR, .; % CI, .-.), whereasscreen-detected cancers tended to be more indolent (% had low risk ofrecurrence genomic scores; % were PAM Luminal A). When stratifying bymammographic density and race, associations between interval detection and poorprognostic features were similar by race and density status. Strong associationsbetween interval cancers and poor-prognosis genomic features (non-Luminal Asubtype and high risk of recurrence score) suggest that aggressive tumor biologyis an important contributor to interval cancer rates.

Methods for inferringmolecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely tobenefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit frommolecular testing based on H&E stained histologic images, we developed an imageanalysis approach using deep learning. A training set of  breast tumors wasused to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAMintrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). Theresulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (nâ=â), andaccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set.Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs.high tumor grade (% accuracy), ER status (% accuracy), Basal-like vs.non-Basal-like (% accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (% accuracy), and high vs.low-medium ROR-PT score (% accuracy). Sampling considerations in the trainingset minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status wassignificantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof ofprinciple that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker(i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy >% based on H&E features.Image-based methods could be promising for identifying patients with a greaterneed for further genomic testing, or in place of classically scored variablestypically accomplished using human-based scoring."

" Sheps Center for Health Services Research","Pharmaceutical assistance programs for cancer patients in the era of orallyadministered chemotherapeutics.","Introduction The rising cost of cancer drugs may make treatment unaffordable forsome patients. Patients often rely on drug manufacturer-administeredPharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) to obtain drugs and reduced or no cost.The overall usage of PAPs within cancer care delivery is unknown. Methods Weincluded all cancer patients across an academically affiliated, integrated healthsystem in North Carolina during  ( Nâ=â). We identified the subset ofpatients receiving PAP assistance to afford one or more cancer drugs, in order tocalculate the proportion of patients receiving PAP assistance, and the retailvalue of the assistance. Results Among  cancer patients,  unique patientssubmitted a total of  successful PAP requests for cancer drugs. % ofPAP-utilizing patients were uninsured, % had Medicaid coverage, % hadMedicare coverage, % were dual Medicare/Medicaid eligible, and % werecommercially insured. Among all cancer patients who received medical treatment,.% required PAP assistance, whereas .% receiving an oral agent required PAPassistance. The proportion receiving PAP assistance varied substantially by drug,ranging from <% of patients (e.g. carboplatin, methotrexate) to % of patients(e.g. ponatinib, temsirolimus). The majority of the retail value obtained was fororal agents, including $,, of imatinib and $,, of dasatinib, whichwere the two drugs with the highest aggregate retail value. Conclusions Asubstantial proportion of cancer patients receive private charitable assistanceto obtain standard-of-care treatments. This includes patients with federal andprivate insurance, suggesting an inability of patients to meet cost-sharingrequirements."

" North Carolina Central University","Application of Integrated Drug Screening/Kinome Analysis to Identify Inhibitorsof Gemcitabine-Resistant Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth.","Continuous exposure of a pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa- (MiaS) togemcitabine resulted in the formation of a gemcitabine-resistant subline (MiaR).In an effort to discover kinase inhibitors that inhibited MiaR growth, MiaR cellswere exposed to kinase inhibitors (PKIS- library) in a -well screeningformat. Three compounds (UNCA, UNCA, and UNCA) wereidentified that inhibited the growth of MiaR cells by more than % (at  nM).Two compounds (UNCA and UNCA) were classified as cyclin-dependentkinase (CDK) inhibitors, whereas UNCA was reported to be a PLK inhibitor.Dose-response experiments supported the efficacy of these compounds to inhibitgrowth and increase apoptosis in D cultures of these cells. However, onlyUNCA significantly inhibited the growth of D spheroids composed of MiaRcells and GFP-tagged cancer-associated fibroblasts. Multiplexed inhibitor bead(MIB)-mass spectrometry (MS) kinome competition experiments identified CDK,CLK-, DYRKA, and CSNK as major kinase targets for UNCA in MiaR cells.Another CDK inhibitor (CDK-IN-) replicated the growth inhibitory effects ofUNCA, whereas inhibitors against the CLK, DYRK, or CSNK kinases had noeffect. In summary, these studies describe a coordinated approach to discovernovel kinase inhibitors, evaluate their efficacy in D models, and define theirspecificity against the kinome."

" University of Minnesota","Effective Message Elements for Disclosures About Chemicals in Cigarette Smoke.","Introduction: Cigarette smoke contains at least  chemicals or ""constituents""that the Food and Drug Administration has identified as harmful and potentiallyharmful constituents to human health. Our study sought to identify whichconstituent disclosure message elements are most effective in discouraging peoplefrom smoking.Methods: Three hundred eighty eight current smokers aged  and older completedan online survey in February . We randomized participants to respond to oneof two sets of  toxic products that contain cigarette constituents and health effects associated with cigarette constituents.Results: Products that elicited the most discouragement were those with lowerchances of exposure (e.g., explosives), followed by products with possibleexposure (e.g., rat poison), and products with a high likelihood of exposure(e.g., floor cleaner). Awareness of toxic products that constituents are found in(p < .) and low exposure products (p < .) were associated with higherdiscouragement. Health effects that people had heard are caused by cigarettesmoke constituents elicited higher discouragement from smoking cigarettes (p <.). Cancer was associated with higher discouragement relative to respiratory,cardiovascular, and reproductive health effects (all p < .).Conclusions: Cigarette smoke constituent messages may be more effective atdiscouraging smoking if they include information about carcinogenic healtheffects (e.g., mouth cancer and lung tumors) and low exposure toxic products(e.g., explosives and radioactive material) as message elements.Implications: Our study identified health effects and toxic products, especiallycancers and rarely encountered toxic products, that may discourage smoking whenincluded in disclosure messages. By constructing messages that communicate theharms associated with tobacco use by contextualizing those harms in terms ofspecific constituents, tobacco education messaging efforts may be increasinglysuccessful."
" University of California","Delivery Strategies for Immune Checkpoint Blockade.","Immune checkpoint blockade, which blocks the regulatory pathways that express onimmune cells to improve antitumor immunological responses, is becoming one of themost promising approaches for antitumor therapy. This therapy has achievedimportant clinical advancement and provided a new opportunity against a varietyof cancers. However, limitations of checkpoint inhibitors application, includingthe risk of autoimmune disease, low objective response rates, and high cost,still largely affect their broad applications in patients. Therefore, it isdesirable to seek effective delivery methods to further enhance the therapeuticefficacy and reduce drawbacks of immune checkpoint blockade. This brief reviewsummarizes strategies to increase the antitumor immunity, including the local andtargeted delivery of checkpoint inhibitors, and a combination of differentcheckpoint inhibitors or with other therapeutic treatments."
" Icahn School of Medicine at Mt","Gut Microbial Î²-Glucuronidase Inhibition via Catalytic Cycle Interception.","Microbial Î²-glucuronidases (GUSs) cause severe gut toxicities that limit theefficacy of cancer drugs and other therapeutics. Selective inhibitors ofbacterial GUS have been shown to alleviate these side effects. Using structuraland chemical biology, mass spectrometry, and cell-based assays, we establish thatpiperazine-containing GUS inhibitors intercept the glycosyl-enzyme catalyticintermediate of these retaining glycosyl hydrolases. We demonstrate thatpiperazine-based compounds are substrate-dependent GUS inhibitors that bind tothe GUS-GlcA catalytic intermediate as a piperazine-linked glucuronide (GlcA,glucuronic acid). We confirm the GUS-dependent formation of inhibitor-glucuronideconjugates by LC-MS and show that methylated piperazine analogs displaysignificantly reduced potencies. We further demonstrate that a range of approvedpiperazine- and piperidine-containing drugs from many classes, including thosefor the treatment of depression, infection, and cancer, function by the samemechanism, and we confirm through gene editing that these compounds selectivelyinhibit GUS in living bacterial cells. Together, these data reveal a uniquemechanism of GUS inhibition and show that a range of therapeutics may impact GUSactivities in the human gut."
" University of Southern California","General Relative Rate Models for the Analysis of Case-Cohort Designs.","A standard approach to analysis of case-cohort data involves fitting log-linearmodels. We describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broadclass of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidenceintervals. We focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembledand events ascertained, but additional information needs to be collected onexplanatory variables. The additional information is ascertained just forindividuals who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohortmembers enumerated at study entry. One appeal of such a case-cohort design isthat this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of severaloutcomes. The ability to fit general relative rate models to case cohort data mayallow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-responseanalyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive andothers multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due tointeraction. We address model fitting for simple random sampling designs as wellas stratified designs. Data on lung cancer among radon exposed men are used toillustrate these methods."

" King's College London","Filling GAPs in our knowledge: ARHGAPA and RACGAP act as oncogenes inbasal-like breast cancers.","Like RAS proteins, the aberrant function of RHO family small GTPases has beenimplicated in driving cancer development and growth. However, unlike the RASfamily, where gain-of-function missense mutations are found in â¼% of all humancancers, missense mutations are relatively rare in RHO proteins. Instead, alteredRHO activity in cancer more commonly arises through the aberrant functions of RHOGTPase regulators. In many cancer types, altered expression and/or mutation ofRHO-selective guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RHOGEFs) or GTPase-activatingproteins (RHOGAPs), which activate or inactivate RHO GTPases, respectively, isobserved. For example, deletion or loss of expression of the RHOA GAP DLC iswell-established to drive cancer growth. Recently, we identified high expressionof  RHOGAPs, ARHGAPA and RACGAP, in the basal-like breast cancer subtype.Unexpectedly, both of these RHOA GAPs exhibited properties of oncoproteins ratherthan tumor suppressors, in contrast to DLC. In this commentary, we summarize ourfindings and speculate that different RHOA GAPs can play distinct roles in cancerdepending on their spatial regulation and cancer type context. We also evaluateour results in light of recently-described cancer genome sequencing studies thathave identified loss-of-function mutations of RHOA in specific cancer types."

We aimed to identify singleÂ nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) that may modify the associations of body massÂ index (BMI), smoking, andgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), with risks of EA and BE.METHODS: We collected data on single BMI measurements, smoking status, andsymptoms of GERD from  patients with EA,  patients with BE, and healthy individuals (controls) participating in the Barrett's and EsophagealAdenocarcinoma Consortium GWAS, the UK Barrett's Esophagus Gene Study, and the UKStomach and Oesophageal Cancer Study. We analyzed , SNPs in DNA samples ofall study subjects. We used standard case-control logistic regression to test forgene-environment interactions.RESULTS: For EA, rs at chromosome p., near the RNFA-LOCgene, showed a borderline significant interaction with smoking status (P =.Ã-).

" Cornell University","Genomic Instability Promoted by Overexpression of Mismatch Repair Factors inYeast: A Model for Understanding Cancer Progression.","Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins act in spellchecker roles to excisemisincorporation errors that occur during DNA replication. Curiously, large-scaleanalyses of a variety of cancers showed that increased expression of MMR proteinsoften correlated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and early recurrence. Tobetter understand these observations, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas and GeneExpression across Normal and Tumor tissue databases to analyze MMR proteinexpression in cancers. We found that the MMR genes MSH and MSH areoverexpressed more frequently than MSH, and that MSH and MSH are oftencooverexpressed as a result of copy number amplifications of these genes. Theseobservations encouraged us to test the effects of upregulating MMR protein levelsin baker's yeast, where we can sensitively monitor genome instability phenotypesassociated with cancer initiation and progression. Msh overexpression (two- tofourfold) almost completely disrupted mechanisms that prevent recombinationbetween divergent DNA sequences by interacting with the DNA polymeraseprocessivity clamp PCNA and by sequestering the Sgs helicase. Importantly,cooverexpression of Msh and Msh (â¼eightfold) conferred, in a PCNAinteraction-dependent manner, several genome instability phenotypes includingincreased mutation rate, increased sensitivity to the DNA replication inhibitorHU and the DNA-damaging agents MMS and -nitroquinoline N-oxide, and elevatedloss-of-heterozygosity. Msh and Msh cooverexpression also altered the cellcycle distribution of exponentially growing cells, resulting in an increasedfraction of unbudded cells, consistent with a larger percentage of cells in G.These novel observations suggested that overexpression of MSH factors affectedthe integrity of the DNA replication fork, causing genome instability phenotypesthat could be important for promoting cancer progression."

"Northwestern University","Review of methodological challenges in comparing the effectiveness of neoadjuvantchemotherapy versus primary debulking surgery for advanced ovarian cancer in theUnited States.","Randomized trials outside the U.S. have found non-inferior survival forneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) foradvanced ovarian cancer (AOC). However, these trials reported lower overallsurvival and lower rates of optimal debulking than U.S. studies, leading toquestions about generalizability to U.S. practice, where aggressive debulking ismore common. Consequently, comparative effectiveness in the U.S. remainscontroversial. We reviewed U.S. comparative effectiveness studies of NACT versusPDS for AOC. Here we describe methodological challenges, compare results totrials outside the U.S., and make suggestions for future research. We identifiedU.S. studies published in  or later that evaluated the comparativeeffectiveness of NACT versus PDS on survival in AOC through a PubMed search. Twoindependent reviewers abstracted data from eligible articles. Nine of articles were eligible for review. Methodological challenges included unmeasuredconfounders, heterogeneous treatment effects, treatment variations over time, andinconsistent measurement of treatment and survival. Whereas some limitations wereunavoidable, several limitations noted across studies were avoidable, includingconditioning on mediating factors and immortal time introduced by measuringsurvival beginning from diagnosis. Without trials in the U.S., non-randomizedstudies are an important source of evidence for the ideal treatment for AOC.However, several methodological challenges exist when assessing the comparativeeffectiveness of NACT versus PDS in a non-randomized setting. Futureobservational studies must ensure that treatment is consistent throughout thestudy period and that treatment groups are comparable. Rapidly-evolving oncologydata networks may allow for identification of treatment intent and otherimportant confounders."

" University of Arkansas","Tumor-derived granulocyte colony-stimulating factor diminishes efficacy of breasttumor cell vaccines.","BACKGROUND: Although metastasis is ultimately responsible for about % of breastcancer mortality, the vast majority of breast-cancer-related deaths are due toprogressive recurrences from non-metastatic disease. Current adjuvant therapiesare unable to prevent progressive recurrences for a significant fraction ofpatients with breast cancer. Autologous tumor cell vaccines (ATCVs) are a safeand potentially useful strategy to prevent breast cancer recurrence, in apersonalized and patient-specific manner, following standard-of-care tumorresection. Given the high intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity in breastcancer, it is important to understand which factors influence the immunogenicityof breast tumor cells in order to maximize ATCV effectiveness.METHODS: The relative immunogenicity of two murine breast carcinomas, T andEMT, were compared in a prophylactic vaccination-tumor challenge model.Differences in cell surface expression of antigen-presentation-related andcostimulatory molecules were compared along with immunosuppressive cytokineproduction. CRISPR/Cas technology was used to modulate tumor-derived cytokinesecretion. The impacts of cytokine deletion on splenomegaly, myeloid-derivedsuppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and ATCV immunogenicity were assessed.RESULTS: Mice vaccinated with an EMT vaccine exhibited significantly greaterprotective immunity than mice vaccinated with a T vaccine. Hybrid vaccinationstudies revealed that the T vaccination induced both local and systemic immuneimpairments. Although there were significant differences between EMT and T inthe expression of costimulatory molecules, major disparities in the secretion ofimmunosuppressive cytokines likely accounts for differences in immunogenicitybetween the cell lines. Ablation of one cytokine in particular,granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), reversed MDSC accumulation andsplenomegaly in the T model. Furthermore, G-CSF inhibition enhanced theimmunogenicity of a T-based vaccine to the extent that all vaccinated micedeveloped complete protective immunity.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer cells that express high levels of G-CSF have thepotential to diminish or abrogate the efficacy of breast cancer ATCVs.Fortunately, this study demonstrates that genetic ablation of immunosuppressivecytokines, such as G-CSF, can enhance the immunogenicity of breast cancercell-based vaccines. Strategies that combine inhibition of immunosuppressivefactors with immune stimulatory co-formulations already under development mayhelp ATCVs reach their full potential."

" Duke University","What Do Breast Cancer Survivors Expect From Exercise?","BACKGROUND: Exercise outcome expectations (OEs) (ie, what one expects to obtainor avoid by exercising) are influential to increase exercise among cancersurvivors.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the accessibility (ie, frequencyone thinks about exercise resulting in an outcome) and importance (ie, one'svalue of the outcome) of OEs among breast cancer survivors.METHODS: Stage IA to IIB breast cancer survivors who were  to  yearsposttreatment completed OE questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used toexamine OE accessibility and importance.RESULTS: The sample (n = ) was .% white, .% African American, .% Asianor Pacific Islander, and .% other. The mean age was  (SD, .) years. Outcomeexpectation importance mean was . (SD, .), indicating OEs are overall""important."" Accessibility mean was . (SD, .), demonstrating breast cancersurvivors think about exercise OEs ""sometimes/% of the time."" There was amoderate (rs = .) relationship between OE importance and accessibility,indicating they are related, yet distinct.CONCLUSIONS: Outcome expectations are generally important to breast cancersurvivors. Thus, OEs may motivate increased exercise among this population.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology providers should encourage patients to thinkabout OEs more often to increase exercise. Compared with traditional approachesof informing patients about exercise benefits, this may be a more comprehensiveand powerful approach to motivate exercise among breast cancer survivors."
" Duke University","Improving Access to Cancer Testing and Treatment in Kenya.","PURPOSE: In response to the increasing cancer burden in Kenya, this studyidentified barriers to patients seeking access to cancer testing and treatmentand to clinicians in delivering these services. Policy recommendations based onfindings are presented.METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured key informant interviews.Purposive sampling was used to recruit  participants: seven oncology cliniciansand seven support and advocacy leaders for patients with cancer. Qualitativeanalysis was used to identify themes.RESULTS: Seven barriers to cancer testing and treatment were identified: highcost of testing and treatment, low level of knowledge about cancer amongpopulation and clinicians, poor health-seeking behaviors among population, longdistances to access diagnostic and treatment services, lack of decentralizeddiagnostic and treatment facilities, poor communication, and lack of bettercancer policy development and implementation.CONCLUSION: Kenyans seeking cancer services face significant barriers that resultin late presentation, misdiagnosis, interrupted treatment, stigma, and fear. Fourpolicy recommendations to improve access for patients with cancer are () improvehealth insurance for patients with cancer; () establish testing and treatmentfacilities in all counties; () acquire diagnosis and treatment equipment andtrain health personnel to screen, diagnose, and treat cancer; and () increasepublic health awareness and education about cancer to improve diagnoses andtreatment. Effective cancer testing and treatment options can be developed toaddress cancer in a resource-constrained environment like Kenya. An in-depth lookat effective interventions and policies being implemented in countries facingsimilar challenges would provide valuable lessons to Kenya's health sector andpolicymakers."

" Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute","Parents' Views on the Best and Worst Reasons for Guideline-Consistent HPVVaccination.","Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination could prevent mostHPV-associated cancers, but few U.S. adolescents are vaccinated according toguidelines. To inform efforts to counsel parents more effectively, we sought toquantify their views on the best and worst reasons for guideline-consistent HPVvaccination. We hypothesized that parents' views would differ according to theirvaccination confidence.Methods: We developed a best-worst scaling experiment toevaluate  reasons healthcare providers commonly give for HPV vaccination. Theinstrument was administered in  via a national online survey to , parentsof adolescents. Parents completed  choice tasks of  reasons each, indicatingthe best and worst reason in each task. We used conditional logistic regressionto rank reasons for the sample overall and by vaccination confidence(low/high).Results: Parents viewed cancer prevention as the best reason for HPVvaccination (P < .). Other commonly endorsed reasons were preventing a commoninfection, having lasting benefits, or being a safe vaccine (all P < .).Reasons viewed as worst were: It is a scientific breakthrough; I got it for myown child; and your child is due (all P < .).

Weinvestigated the causal relevance of TL for lung and head and neck cancers usingMendelian Randomization (MR) and mediation analyses.Methods: We developed a novel genetic instrument for TL in chromosome p.,using variants identified through deep-sequencing, that were genotyped in cancer-free subjects. Next, we conducted an MR analysis of lung (Â  cases,Â  controls) and head and neck cancer ( cases,  controls) using eightgenetic instruments for TL. Lastly, the p. instrument and distinct p.lung cancer risk loci were evaluated using two-sample mediation analysis, toquantify their direct and indirect, telomere-mediated, effects.Results: The multi-allelic p. instrument explained .-.% of TLvariation in our data (pâ=â.âÃâ-).

Lastly, the p. instrument and distinct p.lung cancer risk loci were evaluated using two-sample mediation analysis, toquantify their direct and indirect, telomere-mediated, effects.Results: The multi-allelic p. instrument explained .-.% of TLvariation in our data (pâ=â.âÃâ-). The MR analysis estimated that a base-pair increase in TL increases risk of lung cancer [odds ratio (OR)â=â.,% confidence interval (CI): .-.] and lung adenocarcinoma (ORâ=â., %CI: .-.), but not squamous lung carcinoma (ORâ=â., % CI: .-.) orhead and neck cancers (ORâ=â., % CI: .-.). Mediation analysis of thep. instrument indicated an absence of direct effects on lung cancer risk(ORâ=â., % CI: .-.). Analysis of distinct p. susceptibilityvariants estimated that TL mediates up to % of the observed associations withlung cancer risk.Conclusions: Our findings support a causal role for long telomeres in lung canceraetiology, particularly for adenocarcinoma, and demonstrate that telomeremaintenance partially mediates the lung cancer susceptibility conferred byp. loci."

A preponderance of this research focuses on the Latin American case andon cancer-specific screening. This study seeks to expand knowledge of suchpreventative-health screening differences by analyzing screening rates for bloodsugar, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol among nine groups overall and (forimmigrants) at various stages of US residency. Using nationally representativedata from the National Health Interview Survey, we find that immigrants fromeight geographic regions receive preventative care at lower rates than US-bornWhites and that preventative screening is generally higher after Â years thanduring the first Â years of residency in the United States. Importantly, our dataalso show that screening patterns and trends vary based on region of origin andoutcome.

We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of six cycles of neoadjuvantdose-dense gemcitabine and cisplatin (ddGC) in patients with MIBC. Patients andMethods In this prospective, multicenter phase II study, patients received ddGC(gemcitabine , mg/m on day  and cisplatin  mg/m on days  and ) every weeks for  cycles followed by RC. The primary end point was pathologicdownstaging to non-muscle-invasive disease (< pTN). Patients who did notundergo RC were deemed nonresponders. Pretreatment tumors underwentnext-generation sequencing to identify predictors of chemosensitivity. ResultsForty-nine patients were enrolled from three institutions. The primary end pointwas met, with % of  evaluable patients downstaged to < pTN. Pathologicresponse correlated with improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival.Nineteen patients (%) required toxicity-related dose modifications. Sixty-sevenpercent of patients completed all six planned cycles. No patient failed toundergo RC as a result of chemotherapy-associated toxicities. The most frequenttreatment-related toxicity was anemia (%; grade ). The presence of a presumeddeleterious DNA damage response (DDR) gene alteration was associated withchemosensitivity (positive predictive value for < pTN [%]). No patient with adeleterious DDR gene alteration has experienced recurrence at a median follow-upof  years. Conclusion Six cycles of ddGC is an active, well-toleratedneoadjuvant regimen for the treatment of patients with MIBC. The presence of aputative deleterious DDR gene alteration in pretreatment tumor tissue stronglypredicted for chemosensitivity, durable response, and superior long-termsurvival."
" Fudan University","Development of [F]AlF-NOTA-NT as PET Agents of Neurotensin Receptor- PositivePancreatic Cancer.","Several studies have suggested that neurotensin receptors (NTRs) and neurotensin(NT) greatly affect the growth and survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC). Developing NTR-targeted PET probes could therefore be important for themanagement of a pancreatic cancer patient by providing key information on the NTRexpression profile noninvasively. Despite the initial success on the synthesis ofF-labeled NT PET probes, the labeling procedure generally requires lengthysteps including azeotropic drying of F. Using a straightforward chelationmethod, here we report the simple preparation of aluminum-F-NOTA-NT startingfrom aqueous F. The cell binding test demonstrated that [F]AlF-NOTA-NTmaintained high receptor-binding affinity to NTR. This probe was then furtherevaluated in NTR positive pancreatic tumor models (AsPC- and PANC-). After theadministration of [F]AlF-NOTA-NT, small animal PET studies showed a highcontrast between tumor and background in both models at  and  h time points. Ablocking experiment was performed to demonstrate the receptor specificity: thetumor uptake in AsPC without and with blocking agent was . Â± . and . Â±.%ID/g, respectively, at  h post injection. In summary, a NTR specific PETagent, [F]AlF-NOTA-NT, was prepared through the simple chelation method. ThisNTR-targeted PET probe may not only be used to detect NTR positive pancreatictumors (diagnosis), but also it may be fully integrated to NTR target therapyleading to personalized medicine (theranostic)."

"RTI International","Patient Preferences and Willingness to Pay for Cervical Cancer Prevention inZambia: Protocol for a Multi-Cohort Discrete Choice Experiment.","BACKGROUND: Although most countries in southern Africa have cervical cancerscreening programs, these programs generally fail to reach a significant majorityof women because they are often implemented as pilot or research projects, andthis limits their scope and ability to scale up screening. Some countries haveplanned larger-scale programs, but these have either never been implemented orhave not been successfully scaled up. Most of the global burden of cervicalcancer is experienced in countries with limited resources, and mortality fromcervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women inSub-Saharan Africa.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to learn about preferences for cervicalcancer screening in Zambia, to identify barriers and facilitators for screeninguptake, and to evaluate willingness to pay for screening services to support thescaling up of cervical cancer screening programs.METHODS: We will conduct a discrete choice experiment by interviewing women andmen and asking them to choose among constructed scenarios with varyingcombinations of attributes relevant to cervical cancer screening. To inform thediscrete choice experiment, we will conduct focus groups and interviews aboutgeneral knowledge and attitudes about cervical screening, perception about theavailability of screening, stigma associated with cancer and HIV, and payment forhealth care services. For the discrete choice experiment, we will have a maximumdesign of  choice sets divided into  sets of  tasks each with a sample sizeof - respondents. We will use a hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedureto assess attributes at the following two levels: group and individual levels.RESULTS: The model will generate preferences for attributes to assess the mostimportant features and allow for the assessment of differences among cohorts. Wewill conduct policy simulations reflecting potential changes in the attributes ofthe screening facilities and calculate the projected changes in preference forchoosing to undergo cervical cancer screening. The findings from the discretechoice experiment will be supplemented with interviews, focus groups, and patientsurveys to ensure a comprehensive and context-based interpretation of theresults.CONCLUSIONS: Because willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening has notbeen previously assessed, this will be a unique and important contribution to theliterature. This study will take into account the high HIV prevalence inSub-Saharan Africa and prevailing gender attitudes to identify an optimal packageof interventions to reduce cervical cancer incidence. This simulation of women'sdecisions (and men's support) to undergo screening will lay the foundation forunderstanding the stated preferences and willingness to pay to help design futurescreening programs.REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER: RR-./."

" Penn State College of Medicine","Support for Pharmacist-Provided HPV Vaccination: National Surveys of U.S.Physicians and Parents.","Background: State laws about pharmacists providing human papillomavirus (HPV)vaccines vary considerably, limiting many pharmacists' ability to provide thisimportant cancer prevention service. We characterized physician and parentsupport for pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination for adolescents who are past duefor vaccination.Methods: In  to , we conducted two national U.S. surveysof  primary care physicians (PCPs) and , parents of adolescents.Respondents indicated the extent to which they supported pharmacist-provided HPVvaccination for - to -year-olds who are past due. Respondents could endorsethe provision unconditionally, or only if certain conditions were met, such aspharmacists receiving proper vaccination training. We used multivariable logisticregression to assess correlates of support.Results: Most physicians (%) andparents (%) endorsed pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination if pharmacists hadreceived proper vaccination training, reported vaccine doses to adolescents' PCP,and referred adolescents to PCPs for other health services. Family medicinephysicians were more likely than pediatricians to support trained pharmacistsproviding HPV vaccination [OR = .; % confidence interval (CI) .-.].Support was also higher among physicians who practiced in Western states (OR =.; % CI, .-.). Parents' odds of endorsing trained pharmacistsprovision of HPV vaccine increased with higher overall satisfaction with theirpharmacy's services (OR = .; % CI, .-.), belief in pharmacists'competence in vaccination practices (OR = .; % CI, .-.), and overallvaccine confidence (OR = .; % CI, .-.).Conclusions: To increasesupport for HPV vaccination services, pharmacists should raise awareness abouttheir immunization training and standardize vaccination protocols that ensurecoordination with primary care.Impact: Stakeholders' feedback and buy-in isimportant to help guide expansion of HPV vaccination in pharmacies.

" Kindai University","Protease-activated receptor  activation enhances doxorubicin-inducedcardiotoxicity.","OBJECTIVE: The anti-cancer anthracycline drug Doxorubicin (Dox) causescardiotoxicity. We investigated the role of protease-activated receptor  (PAR-)in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that PAR- enhancedDox-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and cell death ofcardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. The contribution of PAR- toDox-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated by subjecting PAR--/- mice andPAR-+/+ mice to acute and chronic exposure to Dox. Heart function was measuredby echocardiography. PAR--/- mice exhibited significant less cardiac injury anddysfunction compared to PAR-+/+ mice after acute and chronic Dox administration.PAR--/- mice had reduced levels of nitrotyrosine, apoptosis and inflammation intheir heart compared to PAR-+/+ mice. Furthermore, inhibition of PAR- inwild-type mice with vorapaxar significantly reduced the acute Dox-inducedcardiotoxicity.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of PAR- contributes toDox-induced cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of PAR- may be a new approach to reduceDox-induced cardiotoxicity in cancer patients."

In particular, methylation of lysine  in histone H (HKme) hasbeen shown to mediate gene transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, andpre-mRNA splicing. Notably, mutations at or near this residue have been causallylinked to the development of several human cancers. These observations havehelped to illuminate the role of histones themselves in disease and to clarifythe mechanisms by which they acquire oncogenic properties. This perspectivefocuses on recent advances in discovery and characterization of histone Hmutations that impact HK methylation. We also highlight findings that thecommon cancer-related substitution of HK to methionine (HKM) disturbsfunctions of not only HKme-writing enzymes but also HKme-specific readers.The latter case suggests that the oncogenic effects could also be linked to theinability of readers to engage HKM."

" Public Health Sciences Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center","Joint skeleton estimation of multiple directed acyclic graphs for heterogeneouspopulation.","The directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a powerful tool to model the interactions ofhigh-dimensional variables. While estimating edge directions in a DAG oftenrequires interventional data, one can estimate the skeleton of a DAG (i.e., anundirected graph formed by removing the direction of each edge in a DAG) usingobservational data. In real data analyses, the samples of the high-dimensionalvariables may be collected from a mixture of multiple populations. Eachpopulation has its own DAG while the DAGs across populations may have significantoverlap. In this article, we propose a two-step approach to jointly estimate theDAG skeletons of multiple populations while the population origin of each samplemay or may not be labeled. In particular, our method allows a probabilistic softlabel for each sample, which can be easily computed and often leads to moreaccurate skeleton estimation than hard labels. Compared with separate estimationof skeletons for each population, our method is more accurate and robust tolabeling errors. We study the estimation consistency for our method, anddemonstrate its performance using simulation studies in different settings.Finally, we apply our method to analyze gene expression data from breast cancerpatients of multiple cancer subtypes."

Subjects inhaledÂ L of HP-Xe mixture, followed by the acquisition of interleaved ventilationand gas exchange images, from which maps were obtained of the relative HP-Xedistribution in three states: () gaseous, in lung airspaces; () dissolvedinterstitially, in alveolar barrier tissue; and () transferred to red bloodcells (RBCs), in the capillary vasculature. The relative spatial distributions ofHP-Xe in airspaces (regional ventilation) and RBCs (regional gas transfer)were compared. Further, we investigated the degree to which ventilation and RBCtransfer images identified similar functional regions of interest (ROIs) suitablefor functionally guided RT. For the RT patients, both ventilation and RBCfunctional images were used to calculate differences in the lung dose-functionhistogram and functional effective uniform dose.RESULTS: The correlation of ventilation and RBC transfer was ÏÂ =Â .Â Â±Â . inhealthy volunteers. For the RT patients, this correlation was ÏÂ =Â .Â Â±Â .before treatment and ÏÂ =Â .Â Â±Â . after treatment; for the emphysema patientit was ÏÂ =Â ..

" Duke University Medical Center","Correlation of Regional Lung Ventilation and Gas Transfer to Red Blood Cells:Implications for Functional-Avoidance Radiation Therapy Planning.","PURPOSE: To investigate the degree to which lung ventilation and gas exchange areregionally correlated, using the emerging technology of hyperpolarized (HP)-Xemagnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hyperpolarized-Xe MRI studies were performed on institutional review board-approved human subjects, including  healthyvolunteers,  emphysema patient, and  non-small cell lung cancer patients imagedbefore and approximately Â weeks after radiation therapy (RT). Subjects inhaledÂ L of HP-Xe mixture, followed by the acquisition of interleaved ventilationand gas exchange images, from which maps were obtained of the relative HP-Xedistribution in three states: () gaseous, in lung airspaces; () dissolvedinterstitially, in alveolar barrier tissue; and () transferred to red bloodcells (RBCs), in the capillary vasculature. The relative spatial distributions ofHP-Xe in airspaces (regional ventilation) and RBCs (regional gas transfer)were compared. Further, we investigated the degree to which ventilation and RBCtransfer images identified similar functional regions of interest (ROIs) suitablefor functionally guided RT. For the RT patients, both ventilation and RBCfunctional images were used to calculate differences in the lung dose-functionhistogram and functional effective uniform dose.RESULTS: The correlation of ventilation and RBC transfer was ÏÂ =Â .Â Â±Â . inhealthy volunteers. For the RT patients, this correlation was ÏÂ =Â .Â Â±Â .before treatment and ÏÂ =Â .Â Â±Â . after treatment; for the emphysema patientit was ÏÂ =Â ..

" Yale University School of Medicine","Mutant Cellular AP- Proteins Promote Expression of a Subset of Epstein-BarrVirus Late Genes in the Absence of Lytic Viral DNA Replication.","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) ZEBRA protein activates the EBV lytic cycle. CellularAP- proteins with alanine-to-serine [AP-(A/S)] substitutions homologous toZEBRA(S) assume some functions of EBV ZEBRA. These AP-(A/S) mutants bindmethylated EBV DNA and activate expression of some EBV genes. Here, we compareexpression of  viral genes induced by ZEBRA versus expression induced byAP-(A/S) proteins. AP-(A/S) activated  genes to high levels and  genes tointermediate levels; activation of  genes by AP-(A/S) was severely impaired.We show that AP-(A/S) proteins are defective at stimulating viral lytic DNAreplication. The impairment of expression of many late genes compared to that ofZEBRA is likely due to the inability of AP-(A/S) proteins to promote viral DNAreplication. However, even in the absence of detectable viral DNA replication,AP-(A/S) proteins stimulated expression of a subgroup of late genes that encodeviral structural proteins and immune modulators. In response to ZEBRA, expressionof this subgroup of late genes was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), whichis a potent viral replication inhibitor. However, when the lytic cycle wasactivated by AP-(A/S), PAA did not reduce expression of this subgroup of lategenes. We also provide genetic evidence, using the BMRF knockout bacmid, thatthese genes are true late genes in response to ZEBRA. AP-(A/S) binds to thepromoter region of at least one of these late genes, BDLF, encoding an immunemodulator.IMPORTANCE Mutant c-Jun and c-Fos proteins selectively activateexpression of EBV lytic genes, including a subgroup of viral late genes, in theabsence of viral DNA replication. These findings indicate that newly synthesizedviral DNA is not invariably required for viral late gene expression. While viralDNA replication may be obligatory for late gene expression driven by viraltranscription factors, it does not limit the ability of cellular transcriptionfactors to activate expression of some viral late genes. Our results show thatexpression of all late genes may not be strictly dependent on viral lytic DNAreplication. The c-Fos AS mutation has been identified in a human cancer.c-Fos AS in combination with wild-type c-Jun activates the EBV lytic cycle.Our data provide proof of principle that mutant cellular transcription factorscould cause aberrant regulation of viral lytic cycle gene expression and playimportant roles in EBV-associated diseases."

However, even in the absence of detectable viral DNA replication,AP-(A/S) proteins stimulated expression of a subgroup of late genes that encodeviral structural proteins and immune modulators. In response to ZEBRA, expressionof this subgroup of late genes was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), whichis a potent viral replication inhibitor. However, when the lytic cycle wasactivated by AP-(A/S), PAA did not reduce expression of this subgroup of lategenes. We also provide genetic evidence, using the BMRF knockout bacmid, thatthese genes are true late genes in response to ZEBRA. AP-(A/S) binds to thepromoter region of at least one of these late genes, BDLF, encoding an immunemodulator.IMPORTANCE Mutant c-Jun and c-Fos proteins selectively activateexpression of EBV lytic genes, including a subgroup of viral late genes, in theabsence of viral DNA replication. These findings indicate that newly synthesizedviral DNA is not invariably required for viral late gene expression. While viralDNA replication may be obligatory for late gene expression driven by viraltranscription factors, it does not limit the ability of cellular transcriptionfactors to activate expression of some viral late genes. Our results show thatexpression of all late genes may not be strictly dependent on viral lytic DNAreplication. The c-Fos AS mutation has been identified in a human cancer.c-Fos AS in combination with wild-type c-Jun activates the EBV lytic cycle.Our data provide proof of principle that mutant cellular transcription factorscould cause aberrant regulation of viral lytic cycle gene expression and playimportant roles in EBV-associated diseases."

The primarymiRNA sequence was identified for  miRNA genes expressed in Encyclopedia ofDNA Elements (ENCODE) Tier  cell types and human pancreatic islets. Associationanalysis was conducted using logistic regression for BC status overall and bytumor subtype.RESULTS: A novel BC signal was localized to an .-kb region of q. by fourSNPs (rs, rs, rs, and rs) and remainedstatistically significant after multiple test correction (odds ratio (OR) = .,% confidence interval (CI) = .-.; p =â.âÃâ-; false discovery rate(FDR)â=â.). These SNPs reside in a genomic location that includes both thepredicted primary transcript of the noncoding miRNA gene MIR and the firstintron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor -associated protein (BAIAP).

The patient was originally started on a four-drugantituberculous regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and PZA. Aftergenotypic analysis identified the organism as M. bovis (BCG), the regimen waschanged to isoniazid and rifampin for  months. The patient responded well tothis treatment. This case is unique as the patient received only intravesicalmitomycin and did not receive BCG, implying the possibility of transmission fromcontaminated equipment."

Due to previous reports of a high rate of adverseevent when used long-term, concerns have been raised with regard to the use ofself-expandable metal stents in patients with a longer survival.AIM: assess the role of esophageal self-expandable metal stents in patients withadvanced esophageal cancer that have survived longer than six months.METHODS: retrospective study of patients with advanced esophageal cancer with aself-expandable metal stent and a stent placement time greater than six months.RESULTS: forty-two patients were followed up for  days. There was a clinicalimprovement in all patients. However, % of patients experienced an adverseevent. The median stent patency was  days. Endoscopic management was attemptedin all self-expandable metal related adverse events, with a clinical success rateof %. However, the previously treated adverse event recurred in sevenpatients. Multivariate analysis showed that strictures that were traversable withan ultrathin gastroscope were associated with a higher risk of adverse events (p= .).CONCLUSIONS: long-term esophageal stenting in patients with advanced esophagealcancer is associated with a high prevalence of adverse events without an impacton mortality; most cases can be managed endoscopically."

One major hurdle that exists is inadequatedrug delivery due to the desmoplastic stroma and poor vascularization that ischaracteristic of pancreatic cancer. The local iontophoretic delivery ofchemotherapies provides a novel way of improving treatment. With the growingpractice of highly toxic combination therapies in the treatment of pancreaticcancer, the use of iontophoresis for local delivery can potentiate theanti-cancer effects of these therapies while sparing unwanted toxicity. Theobjective of this study was to investigate the impact of formulation on theelectro-transport of the FOLFIRINOX regimen for the development of a newtreatment for pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Three formulations of the FOLFIRINOX regimen (-fluorouracil,leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) were generated at a fixed pH of . andwere referred to as formulation A (single drug solution with all four drugscombined), formulation B (two drug solutions with two drugs per solution), andformulation C (four individual drug solutions). Anodic iontophoresis of the threedifferent formulations was evaluated in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts ofpancreatic cancer.RESULTS: Iontophoretic transport of the FOLFIRINOX drugs was characterizedaccording to organ exposure after a single device treatment in vivo. We reportthat the co-iontophoresis of two drug solutions, leucovorinâ+âoxaliplatin and-fluorouracilâ+âirinotecan, resulted in the highest levels of cytotoxic drugs inthe tumor compared to drugs delivered individually or combined into one solution.There was no significant difference in plasma, pancreas, kidney, and liverexposure to the cytotoxic drugs delivered by the three different formulations.

We used Cox regression to estimate covariate-adjustedhazard ratios (HRs) and % confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality,and cause-specific and subdistribution HRs for breast cancer-specific mortalitywithin  years and  years post-diagnosis conditional on -year survival.RESULTS: We identified three distinct lifestyle patterns: Healthy Behavior andDiet (n=); Healthy Behavior and Unhealthy Diet (n=); and Unhealthy Behaviorand Diet (n=). The Unhealthy (vs. Healthy) Behavior and Diet pattern wasassociated with a -year conditional all-cause mortality HR of .(%CI=.-.) and with -year conditional breast cancer-specific andsubdistribution HRs of . (%CI=.-.) and . (%CI=.-.),respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and dietary patterns can be used to identify lifestylepatterns that influence survival patterns following breast cancer diagnosis."

" Memorial Cancer Institute","Total Medicare Costs Associated With Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancerin Elderly Men.","Importance: Localized prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment among elderly menwho are not likely to benefit represents a potential source of low-value healthcare services.Objective: To quantify the costs to the Medicare program associated withdetection and treatment of prostate cancer among elderly men in the UnitedStates.Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide, population-based,retrospective cohort study uses the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results(SEER)-Medicare linked database to identify men  years or older diagnosed withlocalized prostate cancer between  and  and to ascertain Medicare costsassociated with diagnosis and workup, treatment, follow-up, and morbiditymanagement of the disease. National Medicare costs were estimated usingper-person costs, stage-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates by age from SEER through , and  Census population estimates by age.Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated costs to the Medicare program overall, andin each (mutually exclusive) category related to diagnosis and workup, treatment,follow-up, and morbidity management.Results: This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study includedâ¯ men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the SEER-Medicare database(all participants were  years or older; â¯ [.%] were  years or older).The median per-patient cost within  years after prostate cancer diagnosis was$â¯ (interquartile range [IQR], $-$â¯). The majority of this cost wasattributable to treatment costs (median, $â¯; IQR, $-$â¯). Patientswith a Gleason score of  or lower who pursued initial conservative management(no treatment within  months of diagnosis) had a -year median total cost of$ per patient. The estimated total -year cost to the Medicare programassociated with the annual detection of prostate cancer in men  years or olderis approximately $. billion. Increasing active surveillance use in those withGleason score of  or lower could reduce this cost by $ million.Conclusions and Relevance: There is substantial cost to the Medicare programassociated with the diagnosis and treatment of localized prostate cancer amongelderly men in the United States, despite the fact that these men are unlikely todie of prostate cancer. The majority of costs are related to treatment. Reducingprovision of low-value health care services among this patient population couldresult in significant health care savings."

" University of the Witwatersrand","Costs and cost-effectiveness of LEEP versus cryotherapy for treating cervicaldysplasia among HIV-positive women in Johannesburg, South Africa.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer incidence is significant in countries, such as SouthAfrica, with high burdens of both HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervicalcancer is largely preventable if dysplasia is diagnosed and treated early, butthere is debate regarding the best approaches for screening and treatment,especially for low-resource settings. Currently South Africa provides Pap smearsfollowed by colposcopic biopsy and LEEP if needed in its public healthfacilities. We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches fortreating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade  or higher (CIN+) amongHIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at apublic HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.METHODS: Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis ofdata gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. Inthe trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN+ and eligible for cryotherapy wererandomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN+ at six months asdetermined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of theiroriginal treatment assignment-received LEEP. ""Cure"" was then defined as theabsence of disease at  months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Healthservice costs were estimated using micro-costing between June  and April. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of %. Two differentservice volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysiswere considered in sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: In total,  women with CIN+ were enrolled ( had LEEP;  hadcryotherapy). At  months, cumulative loss to follow-up was .% (/) forthe LEEP group and .% (/) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjustedintention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was nosignificant difference in efficacy. At  months, .% (% CI .-.) ofwomen with CIN+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN+disease. In contrast, .% (% CI .-.) of women assigned to LEEP werefree from disease. On average, women initially treated with cryotherapy were lesscostly per patient randomized at US$ . (.-.), and per case ""cured""at US$ . (.-.). Women in the LEEP group cost US$ .(.-.) per patient randomized and US$ . (.-.) per casecured. In the as-treated analysis, which was based on trial data, LEEP was moreefficacious than cryotherapy; however, the difference was not significant.Cryotherapy remained more cost-effective than LEEP in all sensitivity andscenario analyses.CONCLUSIONS: For this cost-effectiveness analysis, using an intention-to-treatapproach and taking into consideration uncertainty in the clinical and costoutcomes, a strategy involving cryotherapy plus LEEP if needed at six months wasdominant to LEEP plus LEEP again at six months if needed for retreatment.However, compared to other studies comparing LEEP and cryotherapy, the efficacyresults were low in both treatment groups-possibly due to the HIV-positivity ofthe participants. Further research is needed, but at present choosing the ""right""treatment option may be less important than ensuring access to treatment andproviding careful monitoring of treatment outcomes."

We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches fortreating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade  or higher (CIN+) amongHIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at apublic HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.METHODS: Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis ofdata gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. Inthe trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN+ and eligible for cryotherapy wererandomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN+ at six months asdetermined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of theiroriginal treatment assignment-received LEEP. ""Cure"" was then defined as theabsence of disease at  months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Healthservice costs were estimated using micro-costing between June  and April. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of %. Two differentservice volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysiswere considered in sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: In total,  women with CIN+ were enrolled ( had LEEP;  hadcryotherapy). At  months, cumulative loss to follow-up was .% (/) forthe LEEP group and .% (/) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjustedintention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was nosignificant difference in efficacy. At  months, .% (% CI .-.) ofwomen with CIN+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN+disease. In contrast, .% (% CI .-.) of women assigned to LEEP werefree from disease. On average, women initially treated with cryotherapy were lesscostly per patient randomized at US$ . (.-.), and per case ""cured""at US$ . (.-.). Women in the LEEP group cost US$ .(.-.) per patient randomized and US$ . (.-.) per casecured. In the as-treated analysis, which was based on trial data, LEEP was moreefficacious than cryotherapy; however, the difference was not significant.Cryotherapy remained more cost-effective than LEEP in all sensitivity andscenario analyses.CONCLUSIONS: For this cost-effectiveness analysis, using an intention-to-treatapproach and taking into consideration uncertainty in the clinical and costoutcomes, a strategy involving cryotherapy plus LEEP if needed at six months wasdominant to LEEP plus LEEP again at six months if needed for retreatment.However, compared to other studies comparing LEEP and cryotherapy, the efficacyresults were low in both treatment groups-possibly due to the HIV-positivity ofthe participants. Further research is needed, but at present choosing the ""right""treatment option may be less important than ensuring access to treatment andproviding careful monitoring of treatment outcomes."

" Levine Cancer Institute","Personalizing aromatase inhibitor therapy in patients with breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for patients withhormone receptor-positive breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings.Their use in clinical practice has been challenged by significantinter-individual variability in response and tolerability. Hence, the purpose ofthis paper is to provide a succinct review of the literature on the geneticfactors contributing to this variability.DESIGN: A systematic search in PUBMED was conducted to identify studies thatinvestigated the association between germline polymorphisms and disposition,clinical response and toxicities of aromatase inhibitors, as well as thoseevaluating the implications of mutations in ESR on clinical response.RESULTS: Polymorphisms in genes coding for phase I and phase II enzymes(pharmacokinetic genes) significantly modulated exposure to aromatase inhibitors;however, there is a paucity of data linking interindividual variability in drugexposure to clinical response. Furthermore, pharmacogenetic studies interrogatingrelationship between polymorphisms in CYPA (the target site of aromataseinhibitors, i.e. a pharmacodynamic gene) and response yielded conflictingresults. Acquired mutations in ESR receptors have been identified as theunderlying mechanism of resistance to aromatase inhibitors, and likely predictdrug response. Although some pharmacogenetic studies have implicatedpolymorphisms in CYPA and ESR with drug-related side effects, the putativerole of these genes in predicting toxicity warrants further validation.CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genesappear to influence aromatase inhibitor disposition, response and/or toxicity;however, prospective interventional studies are needed to understand theapplication of genomics to personalize aromatase inhibitor therapy in breastcancer patients."

" Murdock Research Institute","Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomic Differences between Hormone-Responsive andTriple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Lines.","Purpose: To conduct an exploratory study to identify mechanisms thatdifferentiate Luminal A (BT and MCF-) and triple-negative (MDA-MB- andMDA-MB-) breast cancer (BCa) cell lines to potentially provide noveltherapeutic targets based on differences in energy utilization.Methods: Cells were cultured in media containing either [U-C]-glucose or[U-C]-glutamine for  hours. Conditioned media and cellular extracts wereanalyzed by H and C NMR spectroscopy.Results: MCF- cells consumed the most glucose, producing the most lactate,demonstrating the greatest Warburg effect-associated energy utilization. BTcells had the highest tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activity. The majority ofenergy utilization patterns in MCF- cells were more similar to MDA-MB- cells,while the patterns for BT cells were more similar to MDA-MB- cells.Compared to the Luminal A cell lines, TNBC cell lines consumed more glutamine andless glucose. BT and MDA-MB- cells produced high amounts of C-glycinefrom media [U-C]-glucose which was integrated into glutathione, indicating denovo synthesis.Conclusions: Stable isotopic resolved metabolomics using C substrates providedmechanistic information about energy utilization that was difficult to interpretusing H data alone. Overall, cell lines that have different hormone receptorstatus have different energy utilization requirements, even if they areclassified by the same clinical BCa subtype; and these differences offer cluesabout optimizing treatment strategies."

" The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center","T-cell Homing Therapy for Reducing Regulatory T Cells and Preserving EffectorT-cell Function in Large Solid Tumors.","Purpose: Infused autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) andtumor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells typically surroundmalignant lesions or penetrate small tumor nodules but fail to penetrate largesolid tumors, significantly compromising their antitumor impact. Strategies toovercome this primary challenge are largely required.Experimental Design: Wetested the effects of IL plus doxorubicin on T-cell penetration and efficacy insolid tumors in a murine lung cancer model, a murine breast carcinoma lungmetastasis model, and two human xenograft tumor models bearing large tumors (>mm).Results: Intriguingly, this simple approach increased the numbers, thedistribution, and the depth of penetration of infused CD+ T cells in thesetumors, including both TILs and CAR T cells. This combined treatment halted tumorprogression and significantly extended survival time. Studies of the underlyingmechanism revealed multiple effects. First, the combined treatment maintained thehigh ratios of immune-stimulatory receptors to immune-inhibitory receptors oninfiltrated CD+ T cells, reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressiveregulatory T cells, and enhanced the numbers of T-bet+ effector T cells in thetumors. Second, doxorubicin induced chemokines CXCL and CXCL, which mayattract NKGD+CD+ T cells to tumors, and this effect was boosted by IL-inducedIFNÎ³ accumulation in tumors, promoting the penetration of NKGD+CD+ Tcells.Conclusions: The deep penetration of infused T cells associated withcombined IL plus doxorubicin yielded striking therapeutic effects in murine andhuman xenograft solid tumors. This approach might broaden the application ofT-cell therapy to a wider range of solid tumors. Clin Cancer Res; ();-. Â© AACRSee related commentary by Berraondo et al., p. ."

However,while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures ofprogression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset ofERÎ±-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remainunclear.METHODS: CBL/ mice were fed a control diet (control, % kcal from fat) orcontrol dietâ+âSDG (SDG, Â mg/kg diet) for  weeks, then orthotopicallyinjected with syngeneic E mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growthwas monitored for  weeks.

" University of Tennessee Medical Center Knoxville","Uterine weight and complications after abdominal, laparoscopic, and vaginalhysterectomy.","BACKGROUND: Although uterine size has been a previously cited barrier tominimally invasive hysterectomy, experienced gynecologic surgeons have been ableto demonstrate that laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy is feasible withincreasingly large uteri. By demonstrating that minimally invasive hysterectomycontinues to have superior outcomes even with increased uterine weights,opportunity exists to meaningfully decrease morbidity, mortality, and costassociated with abdominal hysterectomy.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if there is an association between uterineweight and posthysterectomy complications and if differences in that associationexist across vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal approaches.STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cohort study of prospectively collected qualityimprovement data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical QualityImprovement Program database, composed of patient information and -daypostoperative outcomes from > hospitals across the United States and targeteddata files, which includes additional data on procedure-specific risk factors andoutcomes in > of those participating hospitals. We analyzed patientsundergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions from  through , identifiedby Current Procedural Terminology code. We excluded patients who had cancer,surgery by a nongynecology specialty, or missing uterine weight. Patients werecompared with respect to -day postoperative complications and uterine weight,stratified by surgical approach. Bivariable tests and multivariable logisticregression were used for analysis.RESULTS: In all, , patients were analyzed. After adjusting for potentialconfounders, including medical and surgical variables, women with -g uteriwere >% more likely to have complications compared to women with uteri â¤ g(adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval, .-.; P < .), womenwith -g uteri were nearly % as likely (adjusted odds ratio, .; %confidence interval, .-.; PÂ < .), and women with uteri â¥ g were>% more likely (adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval, .-.;P < .). The incidence of -day postsurgical complications was nearly doublein the abdominal hysterectomy group (%) compared to the laparoscopic group(%). Additionally, for each stratum of uterine weight, abdominal hysterectomyhad significantly higher odds of any complication compared to laparoscopichysterectomy, even after adjusting for potential demographic, medical, andsurgical confounders. For uteri < g, abdominal hysterectomy had twice the oddsof any complication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio,.; % confidence interval, .-.), and among women with uteri between- g, abdominal hysterectomy was associated with an almost % increase inodds of any complication (adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval,.-.). Even among women with uteri > g, abdominal hysterectomy was stillassociated with a >% increased odds of any complication, compared tolaparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval,.-.).CONCLUSION: We found that while uterine weight was an independent risk factor forposthysterectomy complications, abdominal hysterectomy had higher odds of anycomplication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, even for markedly enlargeduteri. Our study suggests that uterine weight alone is not an appropriateindication for abdominal hysterectomy. We also identified that it is safe toperform larger hysterectomies laparoscopically. Patients may benefit fromreferral to experienced surgeons who are able to offer laparoscopic hysterectomyeven for markedly enlarged uteri."
" Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center","Glioblastoma radiomics: can genomic and molecular characteristics correlate withimaging response patterns?","PURPOSE: For glioblastoma (GBM), imaging response (IR) or pseudoprogression (PSP)is frequently observed after chemoradiation and may connote a favorableprognosis. With tumors categorized by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project(mesenchymal, classical, neural, and proneural) and bymethylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, we attempted todetermine if certain genomic or molecular subtypes of GBM were specificallyassociated with IR or PSP.METHODS: Patients with GBM treated at two institutions were reviewed.Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) andprogression-free survival (PFS).

" Cannon Research Center","Text mining-based in silico drug discovery in oral mucositis caused by high-dosecancer therapy.","INTRODUCTION: Oral mucositis (OM) is a major dose-limiting side effect ofchemotherapy and radiation used in cancer treatment. Due to the complex nature ofOM, currently available drug-based treatments are of limited efficacy.OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (i) to determine genes and molecular pathwaysassociated with OM and wound healing using computational tools and publiclyavailable data and (ii) to identify drugs formulated for topical use targetingthe relevant OM molecular pathways.METHODS: OM and wound healing-associated genes were determined by text mining,and the intersection of the two gene sets was selected for gene ontology analysisusing the GeneCodis program. Protein interaction network analysis was performedusing STRING-db. Enriched gene sets belonging to the identified pathways werequeried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates fortopical use in OM.RESULTS: Our analysis identified  genes common to both the ""OM"" and ""woundhealing"" text mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis yielded  genesrepresenting six pathways and targetable by a total of  drugs which couldpossibly be formulated for topical application. A manual search onClinicalTrials.gov confirmed no relevant pathway/drug candidate had beenoverlooked. Twenty-five of the  drugs can directly affect the PTGS (COX-)pathway, the pathway that has been targeted in previous clinical trials withlimited success.CONCLUSIONS: Drug discovery using in silico text mining and pathway analysistools can facilitate the identification of existing drugs that have the potentialof topical administration to improve OM treatment."

We categorized ethnicity/nativity as US-Born non-Hispanic,US-born Hispanic, foreign-born non-Hispanic, and foreign-born Hispanic. ModifiedPoisson models examined associations between ethnicity/nativity and medicationuse, adjusting for tumor, treatment, and demographic characteristics.RESULTS: We included , women, of whom % were US-born non-Hispanics, %US-born Hispanics, % foreign-born non-Hispanics, and % foreign-born Hispanics.Supportive medication use varied by ethnicity/nativity. Compared to US-bornnon-Hispanics, foreign-born Hispanics and non-Hispanics were % (% CI.-.) and % (% CI .-.) less likely to receive supportivemedications, respectively. US-born Hispanics were % (% CI .-.) morelikely to receive supportive medications. Observed differences persisted whenanalyses were limited to stage I-III breast cancer cases.CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights potential disparities in the pharmacologictreatment of psychosocial needs of foreign-born breast cancer patients. Futurestudies should explore if differences observed here are reflective of healthdisparities or differential patient preferences."
" Hershey Medical Center","p-dependent phase separation of patient-derived KEAP mutations and NRF.","Cancer-derived loss-of-function mutations in the KEAP tumor suppressor genestabilize the NRF transcription factor, resulting in a pro-survival geneexpression program that alters cellular metabolism and neutralizes oxidativestress. In a recent genotype-phenotype study, we classified % of KEAPmutations as ANCHOR mutants. By immunoprecipitation, these mutants bind more NRFthan wild-type KEAP and ubiquitylate NRF, but are incapable of promoting NRFdegradation. BioID-based protein interaction studies confirmed increasedabundance of NRF within the KEAP ANCHOR mutant complexes with no otherstatistically significant changes to the complexes. Discrete molecular dynamicsimulation modeling and limited proteolysis suggest that the ANCHOR mutationsstabilize residues in KEAP that contact NRF. The modeling supports anintramolecular salt bridge between the RC ANCHOR mutation and E; mutationof the E residue confirmed the model, resulting in the ANCHOR phenotype. Inlive cells, the KEAP RQ and RC ANCHOR mutants co-localize with NRF,p/SQSTM, and polyubiquitin in structured spherical droplets that rapidly fuseand dissolve. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with confocal fluorescentimaging revealed membraneless phase-separated biomolecular condensates. Wepresent a model wherein ANCHOR mutations form p-dependent biomolecularcondensates that may represent a transitional state between impaired proteasomaldegradation and autophagy."

"University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School","Phase Ib Results of the Rational Combination of Selumetinib and Cyclosporin A inAdvanced Solid Tumors with an Expansion Cohort in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.","MEK inhibition is of interest in cancer drug development, but clinical activityin metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been limited. Preclinical studiesdemonstrated Wnt pathway overexpression in KRAS-mutant cell lines resistant tothe MEK inhibitor, selumetinib. The combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A,a noncanonical Wnt pathway modulator, demonstrated antitumor activity in mCRCpatient-derived xenografts. To translate these results, we conducted a NCI CancerTherapy Evaluation Program-approved multicenter phase I/IB trial (NCT) ofthe combination of selumetinib and cyclosporin A. Patients with advanced solidmalignancies were treated with the combination of oral selumetinib andcyclosporin A in the dose escalation phase, followed by an expansion cohort ofirinotecan and oxaliplatin-refractory mCRC. The expansion cohort utilized asingle-agent selumetinib ""run-in"" to evaluate FZD biomarker upregulation andKRAS-WT and KRAS-MT stratification to identify any potential predictors ofefficacy. Twenty and  patients were enrolled in dose escalation and expansionphases, respectively. The most common adverse events and grade / toxicitieswere rash, hypertension, and edema. Three dose-limiting toxicities (grade hypertension, rash, and increased creatinine) were reported. The MTD wasselumetinib  mg twice daily and cyclosporin A  mg/kg twice daily on a -daycycle. KRAS stratification did not identify any differences in response betweenKRAS-WT and KRAS-MT cancers. Two partial responses,  stable disease, and progressive disease responses were observed.

Women of working age may have differentsocietal pressures than older adults, which could impact their quality of life.Our aims were to (i) adapt the scale specifically for women, (ii) test convergentand structural validity and (iii) test internal consistency reliability.METHOD: First, we completed a literature review to add new items, then measuredpsychometric properties of PActS-W.FINDINGS: A total of  women, one month after cancer surgery completed PActS-W.PActS-W demonstrated convergent-related (physical health rÂ =Â ., mental healthrÂ =Â ., PÂ <Â .), structural validity (CFI, .; RMSEA, .; IFI, ., NFI,.) and high internal consistency reliability (stratified coefficientÎ±Â =Â .).CONCLUSION: The PActS-W may be useful for measuring women's internalised societalpressures after encountering cancer, which relates to their quality of life, butfurther testing is needed."

" Baylor College of Medicine","FGFR-Activated Translation of WNT Pathway Components with Structured ' UTRs IsVulnerable to Inhibition of EIFA-Dependent Translation Initiation.","Cooperativity between WNT and FGF signaling is well documented in embryonicdevelopment and cancer progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying thiscross-talk remain elusive. In this study, we interrogated the dynamics of RNAlevels, ribosome occupancy, and protein expression as a function of inducible FGFsignaling in mouse mammary glands with constitutive WNT hyperactivation.Multiomics correlation analysis revealed a substantial discrepancy between RNAand ribosome occupancy levels versus protein levels. However, this discrepancydecreased as cells became premalignant and dynamically responded to FGFsignaling, implicating the importance of stringent gene regulation innontransformed cells. Analysis of individual genes demonstrated that acute FGFhyperactivation increased translation of many stem cell self-renewal regulators,including WNT signaling components, and decreased translation of genes regulatingcellular senescence. WNT pathway components translationally upregulated by FGFsignaling had long and structured ' UTRs with a high frequency of polypurinesequences, several of which harbored (CGG) motifs that can fold into eitherstable G-quadruplexes or other stable secondary structures. The FGF-mediatedincrease in translation of WNT pathway components was compromised by silvestrol,an inhibitor of EIFA that clamps EIFA to polypurine sequences to block Sscanning and inhibits its RNA-unwinding activity important for translationinitiation. Moreover, silvestrol treatment significantly delayed FGF-WNT-driventumorigenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF signalingselectively enhances translation of structured mRNAs, particularly WNT signalingcomponents, and highlight their vulnerability to inhibitors that target the RNAhelicase EIFA.Significance: The RNA helicase EIFA may serve as a therapeutictarget for breast cancers that require FGF and WNT signaling.

" Brtish Columbia Cancer Agency","Histone deacetylase inhibitors synergizes with catalytic inhibitors of EZH toexhibit anti-tumor activity in small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemictype.","Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare butextremely lethal malignancy that mainly impacts young women. SCCOHT ischaracterized by a diploid genome with loss of SMARCA and lack of SMARCAexpression, two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelingcomplex. We and others have identified the histone methyltransferase EZH as apromising therapeutic target for SCCOHT, suggesting that SCCOHT cells depend onthe alternation of epigenetic pathways for survival. In this study, we found thatSCCOHT cells were more sensitive to pan-HDAC inhibitors compared to other ovariancancer lines or immortalized cell lines tested. Pan-HDAC inhibitors, such asquisinostat, reversed the expression of a group of proteins that were deregulatedin SCCOHT cells due to SMARCA loss, leading to growth arrest, apoptosis anddifferentiation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth of xenografted tumors ofSCCOHT cells. Moreover, combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors and EZH inhibitorsat sub-lethal doses synergistically induced histone HK acetylation and targetgene expression, leading to rapid induction of apoptosis and growth suppressionof SCCOHT cells and xenografted tumors. Therefore, our preclinical studyhighlighted the therapeutic potential of combined treatment of HDAC inhibitorswith EZH catalytic inhibitors to treat SCCOHT."

"University College Hospital","Development of Evidence-Based Surveillance Intervals After RadiofrequencyAblation of Barrett's Esophagus.","BACKGROUND & AIMS: Barrett's esophagus (BE) recurs in % or more of patientstreated successfully with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), so surveillanceendoscopy is recommended after complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia(CEIM). The frequency of surveillance is informed only by expert opinion. Weaimed to model the incidence of neoplastic recurrence, validate the model in anindependent cohort, and propose evidence-based surveillance intervals.METHODS: We collected data from the United States Radiofrequency AblationRegistry (US RFA, -) and the United Kingdom National Halo Registry (UKNHR, -) to build and validate models to predict the incidence ofneoplasia recurrence after initially successful RFA. We developed  categories ofrisk and modeled intervals to yield .% risk of recurrence with invasiveadenocarcinoma. We fit Cox proportional hazards models assessing discriminationby CÂ statistic and % confidence limits.RESULTS: The incidence of neoplastic recurrence was associated with most severehistologic grade before CEIM, age, endoscopic mucosal resection, sex, andbaseline BE segment length. In multivariate analysis, a model based solely onmost severe pre-CEIM histology predicted neoplastic recurrence with a C statisticof . (% confidence limit, .-.) in the US RFA registry. This modelalso performed well when we used data from the UK NHR. Our model divided patientsinto  risk groups based on baseline histologic grade: non-dysplastic BE;indefinite for dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, and high-grade dysplasia; orintramucosal adenocarcinoma.

Elevated MSI levelsin a variety of human cancer are associated with up-regulation of Notch/Wntsignaling. MSI binds to and negatively regulates translation of Numb and APC(adenomatous polyposis coli), negative regulators of Notch and Wnt signalingrespectively.METHODS: Previously, we have shown that the natural product (-)-gossypol as thefirst known small molecule inhibitor of MSI that down-regulates Notch/Wntsignaling and inhibits tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Using a fluorescencepolarization (FP) competition assay, we identified gossypolone (Gn) withaâ>â-fold increase in Ki value compared to (-)-gossypol. We validated Gnbinding to MSI using surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, andcellular thermal shift assay, and tested the effects of Gn on colon cancer cellsand colon cancer DLD- xenografts in nude mice.RESULTS: In colon cancer cells, Gn reduced Notch/Wnt signaling and inducedapoptosis. Compared to (-)-gossypol, the same concentration of Gn is less activein all the cell assays tested. To increase Gn bioavailability, we used PEGylatedliposomes in our in vivo studies. Gn-lip via tail vein injection inhibited thegrowth of human colon cancer DLD- xenografts in nude mice, as compared to theuntreated control (Pâ<â., nâ=â).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that PEGylation improved the bioavailability of Gnas well as achieved tumor-targeted delivery and controlled release of Gn, whichenhanced its overall biocompatibility and drug efficacy in vivo.

However, standard administration of these therapeuticsas free antibodies results in suboptimal T-cell binding events, with only asubset of the T-cells binding to both aPD and aOX. Here, it is shown thatprecise spatiotemporal codelivery of aPD and aOX using nanoparticles (NP)(dual immunotherapy nanoparticles, DINP) results in improved T-cell activation,enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and increased immunological memory. It isdemonstrated that DINP elicits higher rates of T-cell activation in vitro thanfree antibodies. Importantly, it is demonstrated in two tumor models thatcombination immunotherapy administered in the form of DINP is more effective thanthe same regimen administered as free antibodies. This work demonstrates a novelstrategy to improve combination immunotherapy using nanotechnology."
" University of Kansas ","Structure-Based Design of Inhibitors with Improved Selectivity for SteroidogenicCytochrome P A over Cytochrome P A.","Inhibition of androgen biosynthesis is clinically effective for treatingandrogen-responsive prostate cancer. Abiraterone is a clinical first-in-classinhibitor of cytochrome P A (CYPA) required for androgen biosynthesis.However, abiraterone also causes hypertension, hypokalemia, and edema, likely duein part to off-target inhibition of another steroidogenic cytochrome P,CYPA. Abiraterone analogs were designed based on structural evidence thatB-ring substituents may favorably interact with polar residues in binding CYPAand sterically clash with residues in the CYPA active site.

" University of California","Integrative pipeline for profiling DNA copy number and inferring tumor phylogeny.","Summary: Copy number variation is an important and abundant source of variationin the human genome, which has been associated with a number of diseases,especially cancer. Massively parallel next-generation sequencing allows copynumber profiling with fine resolution.

" Federal University of Sao Paulo","Postoperative outcomes of esophagectomy for cancer in elderly patients.","BACKGROUND: The number of elderly patients with esophageal cancer is expected toincrease. We aimed to determine the postoperative outcomes of esophagectomy foresophageal cancer in elderly patients.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective, population-based analysis was performedusing the National inpatient sample for the period -. Adult patients â¥years old (yo) diagnosed with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomyduring their inpatient hospitalization were included. Patients were categorizedinto < yo and â¥ yo. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were usedto assess the potential effect of age on postoperative complications, inpatientmortality, and hospital charges.RESULTS: Overall,  patients were included, with  (.%) < yo and (.%) â¥ yo. The yearly rate of esophagectomies among patients â¥ yo did notsignificantly changed duringÂ the study period (.% in  and .% in ,PÂ =Â .). Elderly patients were significantly more likely to have postoperativecardiac failure (odds ratio ., % confidence interval [CI] ., .,PÂ =Â .) and inpatient mortality (odds ratio ., % CI ., .,PÂ <Â .). Among the elderly patients, hospital charges were, on average,$, greater (% CI $, $,) than patients < yo (PÂ =Â .). Thepredicted probability of mortality increased consistently across age (.% in yo, .% in  yo, .% in  yo, .% in  yo, and .% in  yo).CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer have asignificantly higher risk of postoperative mortality and pose a higher financialburden on the health care system.

Only seven previous cases have beenmentioned in the literature. The pathogenesis remains unclear although genetic,environmental, and maternal factors may play a role. The number of cases is toofew to determine the best treatment options, but surgical excision and adjunctiveorbital radiotherapy appear to be most appropriate.CONCLUSIONS: Although metastases to the orbit are rare, seminoma should beconsidered in the differential diagnosis of all young men with proptosis."
" Dalhousie University","Survivorship care plans: are randomized controlled trials assessing outcomes thatare relevant to stakeholders?","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes assessed in extantrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) to outcomes that stakeholders expect fromsurvivorship care plans (SCPs). To facilitate the transition from activetreatment to follow-up care for the . million US cancer survivors, manyorganizations require SCP use. However, results of several RCTs of SCPs'effectiveness have been null, possibly because they have evaluated outcomes onwhich SCPs should be expected to have limited influence. Stakeholders (e.g.,survivors, oncologists) may expect outcomes that differ from RCTs' outcomes.METHODS: We identified RCTs' outcomes using a PubMed literature review. Weidentified outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs using semistructuredinterviews with stakeholders in three healthcare systems in the USA and Canada.Finally, we mapped RCTs' outcomes onto stakeholder-identified outcomes.RESULTS: RCT outcomes did not fully address outcomes that stakeholders expectedfrom SCPs, and RCTs assessed outcomes that stakeholders did not expect from SCPs.RCTs often assessed outcomes only from survivors' perspectives.CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of SCPs' effectiveness have not assessed outcomes thatstakeholders expect. To better understand SCPs' effectiveness, future RCTs shouldassess outcomes of SCP use that are relevant from the perspective of multiplestakeholders.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: SCPs' effectiveness may be optimized when usedwith an eye toward outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs. For survivors,this means using SCPs as a map to guide them with respect to what kind offollow-up care they should seek, when they should seek it, and from whom theyshould seek it."

In the initial DL ( mg), of  patients experienced grade - immune-related adverse events (IRAE) thatwere reversible with drug discontinuation and/or systemic steroids. In DL,  of patients experienced grade  or higher IRAE; thus, DL ( mg/kg) was expandedwith no grade - IRAEs reported in  additional patients.

Five patients underwent allografting without excessive toxicity. Mediansurvival for the group was  days (% CI, -+). Patients who achieved PSDor mCR had significantly higher frequency of T cells expressing ICOS (inducibleT-cell co-stimulator).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ipilimumab dosed at mg/kg in patients with MDS after HMA failure is safe but has limited efficacyas a monotherapy. Increased frequency of ICOS-expressing T cells might predictclinical benefit. Clin Cancer Res; (); -. Â© AACR."

" Oncology Institute","The Persistent Problem of Local/Regional Failure After Surgical Intervention forEarly-Stage Lung Cancer.","BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to estimate the rate oflocal/regional failure (LRF) after definitive surgical intervention forearly-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without postoperativeradiotherapy, in the era of contemporary imaging and minimally invasive surgicaltechniques.METHODS: Medical records of patients with early-stage NSCLC (pathologic T-,N-) who underwent lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy,with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, between  and , wereretrospectively reviewed. LRF was defined as recurrence at the ipsilateral lung,bronchial stump, mediastinum, chest wall, or supraclavicular region. TheKaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to LRF, with patients censored atdeath, and log-rank tests were used for comparisons. A two-sided p value of lessthan . was considered significant.RESULTS: Included were  patients (median age,  years). Preoperative stagingwith positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed in % ofpatients, mediastinoscopy was performed in %, and video-assisted thoracoscopicsurgery was performed in %. At a median follow-up of  months (range,  to months), the -year estimated LRF was % (% confidence interval, % to %).LRF rates were not significantly different in those with and without stagingpositron emission tomography/computed tomography (hazard ratio, .; pÂ = .)and those with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy(hazard ratio, .; pÂ = .).CONCLUSIONS: Despite contemporary staging procedures and surgical techniques forearly-stage NSCLC, LRF occurs in approximately  of  patients. The observedrates of LRF are similar to those reported more than a decade ago, suggestingthat local/regional control remains a persistent problem. The use of additionallocal treatments, such as radiotherapy, should be reevaluated to further improveoutcomes."
" The University of Virginia","Deadly DAaRTS destroy cancer cells via a tumor microenvironment-mediated trigger.","Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment play a supportive role in tumorgrowth, progression, and treatment resistance; therefore, these nonmalignantcells are potential therapeutic targets. In this issue of the JCI, Szot et al.devised a strategy to exploit the cell-surface marker TEM (also known asANTXR), which is expressed by cancer-associated stromal cells, as a zip code todeliver an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) linked to the potent cancer-killing drugmonomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In preclinical tumor and experimental metastasismodels of multiple cancer types, TEM-ADC targeted TEM-expressingcancer-associated stromal cells, which processed and liberated membrane-permeableMMAE and released this drug via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter.Released MMAE killed cancer cells through a bystander mechanism that did minimaldamage to the stromal cells themselves. P-gp-expressing tumor cells displayedMMAE resistance, suggesting that P-gp expression status may identify patients whomight benefit the most from TEM-ADC. This strategy, termed DAaRTS (drugactivation and release through stroma), represents an elegant example of howselective expression of a cell-surface molecule on cancer-associated stroma canbe exploited to facilitate drug delivery and shrink solid tumors."

" Hospital AlemÃ¡n of Buenos Aires","Esophageal Cancer Surgery: Spontaneous Centralization in the US Contributed toReduce Mortality Without Causing Health Disparities.","BACKGROUND: Improvement in mortality has been shown for esophagectomies performedat high-volume centers.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if centralization of esophageal cancersurgery occurred in the US, and to establish its impact on postoperativemortality. In addition, we aimed to analyze the relationship betweenregionalization of cancer care and health disparities.METHODS: A retrospective population-based analysis was performed using theNational Inpatient Sample for the period -. Adult patients (â¥Â Â years ofage) diagnosed with esophageal cancer and who underwent esophagectomy wereincluded. Yearly hospital volume was categorized as low (<Â  procedures),intermediate (- procedures), and high (>Â  procedures). Multivariableanalyses on the potential effect of hospital volume on patient outcomes wereperformed, and the yearly rate of esophagectomies was estimated using Poissonregression.RESULTS: A total of  patients were included. Esophagectomy at low- [oddsratio (OR) .] and intermediate-volume (OR .) hospitals, compared withhigh-volume hospitals, was associated with a significant increase in mortality.The percentage of esophagectomies performed at high-volume centers significantlyincreased during the study period (.-.%; pÂ <Â .). The trend towardshigh-volume hospitals was different among the different US regions: South(.-.%), West (.-.%), Midwest (.-.%), and Northeast (.-.%)[pÂ <Â .]. Overall, the mortality rate of esophagectomy dropped from . to.% (pÂ =Â .), with non-White race, public insurance, and low household incomepatients also showing a significant reduction in mortality.CONCLUSIONS: A spontaneous centralization for esophageal cancer surgery occurredin the US. This process was associated with a decrease in the mortality rate,without contributing to health disparities."
" Duke University Medical Center","The vitamin D receptor gene as a determinant of survival in pancreatic cancerpatients: Genomic analysis and experimental validation.","PURPOSE: Advanced pancreatic cancer is a highly refractory disease almost alwaysassociated with survival of little more than a year. New interventions based onnovel targets are needed. We aim to identify new genetic determinants of overallsurvival (OS) in patients after treatment with gemcitabine using genome-widescreens of germline DNA. We aim also to support these findings with in vitrofunctional analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide screens of germline DNA in two independentcohorts of pancreatic cancer patients (from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B(CALGB)  and the Mayo Clinic) were used to select new genes associated withOS. The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) was selected, and the interactions ofgenetic variation in VDR with circulating vitamin D levels and gemcitabinetreatment were evaluated. Functional effects of common VDR variants were alsoevaluated in experimental assays in human cell lines.RESULTS: The rs variant in VDR was associated with OS in patients fromboth the Mayo Clinic (HR ., % CI .-., p = .) and CALGB  (HR., .-., p = .). rs interacted with high pre-treatment levelsof -hydroxyvitamin D ((OH)D, a measure of endogenous vitamin D) (p = .for interaction) and with gemcitabine treatment (p = . for interaction) toconfer increased OS. rs increased transcriptional activity in luciferaseassays and reduced the binding of the IRF transcription factor.CONCLUSION: Our findings propose VDR as a novel determinant of survival inadvanced pancreatic cancer patients.

" Purdue University School of Pharmacy and the Purdue Center for Cancer Research","Characterization and structure-activity relationships ofindenoisoquinoline-derived topoisomerase I inhibitors in unsilencing the dormantUbea gene associated with Angelman syndrome.","Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorderlacking effective therapies. AS is caused by mutations in ubiquitin proteinligase EA (UBEA), which is genomically imprinted such that only the maternallyinherited copy is expressed in neurons. We previously demonstrated thattopoisomerase I (Top) inhibitors could successfully reactivate the dormantpaternal allele of Ubea in neurons of a mouse model of AS. We also previouslyshowed that one such Top inhibitor, topotecan, could unsilence paternal UBEA ininduced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with AS. Althoughtopotecan has been well-studied and is FDA-approved for cancer therapy, itslimited CNS bioavailability will likely restrict the therapeutic use of topotecanin AS. The goal of this study was to identify additional Top inhibitors withsimilar efficacy as topotecan, with the expectation that these could be tested inthe future for safety and CNS bioavailability to assess their potential as AStherapeutics.Methods: We tested  indenoisoquinoline-derived Top inhibitors to identifycompounds that unsilence the paternal allele of Ubea in mouse neurons. Primarycortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day . (E.) mice with aUbea-YFP fluorescent tag on the paternal allele (Ubeam+/pYFP mice) or mice thatlack the maternal Ubea allele and hence model AS (Ubeam-/p+ mice). Neurons werecultured for Â days, treated with drug for Â h, and examined for paternal UBEAprotein expression by Western blot or fluorescence immunostaining. Dose responsesof the compounds were determined across a log range of drug treatments, andcytotoxicity was tested using a luciferase-based assay.Results: All  indenoisoquinoline-derived Top inhibitors unsilenced paternalUbea. Several compounds exhibited favorable paternal Ubea unsilencingproperties, similar to topotecan, and of these, indotecan (LMP) was the mosteffective based on estimated Emax (maximum response of unsilencing paternalUbea) and EC (half maximal effective concentration).Conclusions: We provide pharmacological profiles of indenoisoquinoline-derivedTop inhibitors as paternal Ubea unsilencers. All  tested compounds wereeffective at unsilencing paternal Ubea, although with variable efficacy andpotency. Indotecan (LMP) demonstrated a better pharmacological profile ofUbea unsilencing compared to our previous lead compound, topotecan. Takentogether, indotecan and its structural analogues are potential AS therapeuticswhose translational potential in AS treatment should be further assessed."

"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center","The case against endometrial ablation for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Endometrial ablation is a common treatment for heavy menstrualbleeding, but serious limitations and long-term complications exist. Our purposeis to summarize the use of endometrial ablation devices, potential short-term andlong-term complications, cost effectiveness, and quality of life in relation toalternative treatments.RECENT FINDINGS: There is insufficient evidence to strongly recommend oneendometrial ablation device over another. Providers should consider and discusswith their patients, complications including risk of future pregnancy,endometrial cancer, and hysterectomy for continued bleeding or pain. Patientselection is key to reducing postablation pain and failure; patients with ahistory of tubal ligation and dysmenorrhea should consider alternativetreatments. All patients should also be counseled that the levonorgestrelintrauterine device is a cost-effective alternative with higher quality of lifeand fewer complications. Hysterectomy is definitive treatment with higher qualityof life and fewer complications.SUMMARY: Although endometrial ablation can offer adequate symptom control forpatients who have failed medical therapy, desire uterine preservation, or who arehigh-risk surgical candidates, patients should be appropriately selected andcounseled regarding the potential for treatment failure and long-termcomplications."

"UNC-HIV Cure Center","Î³Î´ T cells: an immunotherapeutic approach for HIV cure strategies.","Current strategies aimed to cure HIV infection are based on combined efforts toreactivate the virus from latency and improve immune effector cell function toclear infected cells. These strategies are primarily focused on CD+ T cells andapproaches are challenging due to insufficient HIV antigen production frominfected cells and poor HIV-specific CD+ T cells. Î³Î´ T cells represent a uniquesubset of effector T cells that can traffic to tissues, and selectively targetcancer or virally infected cells without requiring MHC presentation. We analyzedwhether Î³Î´ T cells represent a complementary/alternative immunotherapeuticapproach towards HIV cure strategies. Î³Î´ T cells from HIV-infected virologicallysuppressed donors were expanded with bisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM) and cellswere used in autologous cellular systems ex vivo. These cells (a) are potentcytotoxic effectors able to efficiently inhibit HIV replication ex vivo, (b)degranulate in the presence of autologous infected CD+ T cells, and (c)specifically clear latently infected cells after latency reversal withvorinostat. This is the first proof of concept to our knowledge showing that Î³Î´ Tcells target and clear autologous HIV reservoirs upon latency reversal. Ourresults open potentially new insights into the immunotherapeutic use of Î³Î´ Tcells for current interventions in HIV eradication strategies."

" Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","Evaluation of Interventions Intended to Increase Colorectal Cancer ScreeningRates in the United States: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","Importance: Colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is recommended by all major USmedical organizations but remains underused.Objective: To identify interventions associated with increasing CRC screeningrates and their effect sizes.Data Sources: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January , ,to August , . Key search terms included colorectal cancer and screening.Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of US-based interventions in clinicalsettings designed to improve CRC screening test completion in average-riskadults.Data Extraction and Synthesis: At least  investigators independently extracteddata and appraised each study's risk of bias. Where sufficient data wereavailable, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain either a pooled riskratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for screening completion for each type ofintervention.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was completion of CRC screening.Examination included interventions to increase completion of () initial CRCscreening by any recommended modality, () colonoscopy after an abnormal initialscreening test result, and () continued rounds of annual fecal blood tests(FBTs).Results: The main review included  randomized clinical trials comprisingâ¯ patients at low or medium risk of bias. Interventions that wereassociated with increased CRC screening completion rates compared with usual careincluded FBT outreach (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%),patient navigation (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%),patient education (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%), patientreminders (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%), clinicianinterventions of academic detailing (RD, %; % CI, %-%), and clinicianreminders (RD, %; % CI, %-%). Combinations of interventions (clinicianinterventions or navigation added to FBT outreach) were associated with greaterincreases than single components (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI,%-%). Repeated mailed FBTs with navigation were associated with increasedannual FBT completion (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%).Patient navigation was not associated with colonoscopy completion after aninitial abnormal screening test result (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; %CI, %-%).Conclusions and Relevance: Fecal blood test outreach and patient navigation,particularly in the context of multicomponent interventions, were associated withincreased CRC screening rates in US trials. Fecal blood test outreach should beincorporated into population-based screening programs. More research is needed oninterventions to increase adherence to continued FBTs, follow-up of abnormalinitial screening test results, and cost-effectiveness and other implementationbarriers for more intensive interventions, such as navigation."

The factors influencing livermetastasis of CRC are poorly characterized, but this information is urgentlyneeded. We have now discovered that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, exosomes)derived from CRC can be specifically targeted to liver tissue and induce livermacrophage polarization toward an interleukin- (IL-)-secreting pro-inflammatoryphenotype. More importantly, we found that microRNA--p (miR-) was highlyenriched in CRC-derived sEVs and was essential for creating a liverpro-inflammatory phenotype and liver metastasis of CRC.

The occurrence ofneoplasms was a prespecified, exploratory secondary end point. Post hoc analysesof the time to the first confirmed neoplasms were conducted using a Coxregression model.RESULTS: Neoplasm was confirmed in .% of patients with liraglutide versus .%with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] . [% CI .; .]). The HR (% CI) forliraglutide versus placebo was . (.; .) for malignant neoplasms and .(.; .) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasmsoccurring < year or < years after randomization and analyses by sex providedsimilar results. In our main analyses, the % CI for the HR included one for allmalignant neoplasms evaluated (including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) exceptfor prostate neoplasms, which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients.CONCLUSIONS: LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk. Firmconclusions cannot be made regarding numeric imbalances observed for individualneoplasm types (e.g., pancreatic cancer) that occurred infrequently. LEADER datado, however, exclude a major increase in the risk of total malignant neoplasmswith liraglutide versus placebo. Additional studies are needed to assesslonger-term exposure."

There is a single-item pain intensity item. The PROMIS-was translated into Chichewa and validated for use in Malawi using mixedqualitative and quantitative methods. The validity and reliability of thePROMIS- was assessed.RESULTS: Fifty-four pediatric patients with lymphoma completed the PROMIS-.Structural validity was supported by interitem correlations and principalcomponent analysis. Reliability of each scale was satisfactory (rangealphaÂ =Â .-.).

"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine","Improved Tumor Purity Metrics in Next-generation Sequencing for ClinicalPractice: The Integrated Interpretation of Neoplastic Cellularity and SequencingResults (IINCaSe) Approach.","Neoplastic cellularity contributes to the analytic sensitivity of most presenttechnologies for mutation detection, such that they underperform when stroma andinflammatory cells dilute a cancer specimen's variant fraction. Thus, tumorpurity assessment by light microscopy is used to determine sample adequacy beforesequencing and to interpret the significance of negative results and mutantallele fraction afterwards. However, pathologist estimates of tumor purity areimprecise and have limited reproducibility. With the advent of massively parallelsequencing, large amounts of molecular data can be analyzed by computationalpurity algorithms. We retrospectively compared tumor purity of  computationalalgorithms with neoplastic cellularity using hematoxylin and eosin lightmicroscopy to determine which was best for clinical evaluation of molecularprofiling. Data were analyzed from  cancer patients from a clinical trialcohort, LCCC (UNCseq), whose tumors had targeted massively parallelsequencing. Concordance among algorithms was poor, and the specimens analyzed hadhigh rates of algorithm failure partially due to variable tumor purity.Computational tumor purity estimates did not add value beyond the pathologist'sestimate of neoplastic cellularity microscopy. To improve present methods, wepropose a semiquantitative, clinically applicable strategy based on mutant allelefraction and copy number changes present within a given specimen, which whencombined with the morphologic tumor purity estimate, guide the interpretation ofnext-generation sequencing results in cancer patients.This is an open-accessarticle distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives License .

" University of Tennessee Health Science Center","Improved Tumor Purity Metrics in Next-generation Sequencing for ClinicalPractice: The Integrated Interpretation of Neoplastic Cellularity and SequencingResults (IINCaSe) Approach.","Neoplastic cellularity contributes to the analytic sensitivity of most presenttechnologies for mutation detection, such that they underperform when stroma andinflammatory cells dilute a cancer specimen's variant fraction. Thus, tumorpurity assessment by light microscopy is used to determine sample adequacy beforesequencing and to interpret the significance of negative results and mutantallele fraction afterwards. However, pathologist estimates of tumor purity areimprecise and have limited reproducibility. With the advent of massively parallelsequencing, large amounts of molecular data can be analyzed by computationalpurity algorithms. We retrospectively compared tumor purity of  computationalalgorithms with neoplastic cellularity using hematoxylin and eosin lightmicroscopy to determine which was best for clinical evaluation of molecularprofiling.

" Duke University School of Medicine","Symptom and function profiles of men with localized prostate cancer.","BACKGROUND: Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer seek information on howtreatment options may impact their health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Theauthors used latent profile analysis (LPA) to group men according to theirsymptom burden and functional status and to identify patient characteristicsassociated with each HRQOL profile.METHODS: Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement InformationSystem and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite measures  months aftertreatment initiation. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,diarrhea, urinary obstruction, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and sexsatisfaction were modeled jointly using LPA, and the analysis was adjusted forcovariates to examine associations between patient characteristics and profiles.RESULTS: One-third of the  men were not non-Hispanic white (% were black).Four LPA profiles were identified. Men who experienced the ""best HRQOL"" were lesslikely to receive treatment, to be older, and to smoke. Men in the second bestprofile experienced symptoms similar to men in the best HRQOL group but reportedpoor sexual and urinary function, because they were more likely to receivetherapy. The third profile included men with increased symptom burden and poorfunctioning who were likely to undergo prostatectomy and to have increasedcomorbidity. The ""worst HRQOL"" group experienced the worst symptoms and thepoorest functioning, and these men were more likely to be younger, to have morecomorbidities, and to smoke.CONCLUSIONS: LPA revealed that men who receive the same treatment can experiencevery different HRQOL impact.

Theauthors used latent profile analysis (LPA) to group men according to theirsymptom burden and functional status and to identify patient characteristicsassociated with each HRQOL profile.METHODS: Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement InformationSystem and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite measures  months aftertreatment initiation. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,diarrhea, urinary obstruction, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and sexsatisfaction were modeled jointly using LPA, and the analysis was adjusted forcovariates to examine associations between patient characteristics and profiles.RESULTS: One-third of the  men were not non-Hispanic white (% were black).Four LPA profiles were identified. Men who experienced the ""best HRQOL"" were lesslikely to receive treatment, to be older, and to smoke. Men in the second bestprofile experienced symptoms similar to men in the best HRQOL group but reportedpoor sexual and urinary function, because they were more likely to receivetherapy. The third profile included men with increased symptom burden and poorfunctioning who were likely to undergo prostatectomy and to have increasedcomorbidity. The ""worst HRQOL"" group experienced the worst symptoms and thepoorest functioning, and these men were more likely to be younger, to have morecomorbidities, and to smoke.CONCLUSIONS: LPA revealed that men who receive the same treatment can experiencevery different HRQOL impact. Understanding the factors most associated withpoorer HRQOL allows clinicians to focus their care on individuals most in need ofsymptom management and support. Cancer ;:-. Â©  American CancerSociety."
" Duke University Medical Center","miRNA- Binds and Activates TRPA Extracellularly to Evoke Acute and ChronicPruritus.","Increasing evidence suggests that extracellular miRNAs may serve as biomarkers ofdiseases, but the physiological relevance of extracellular miRNA is unclear. Wefind that intradermal cheek injection of miR- induces TRPA-depedent itch(scratching) without pain (wiping) in naive mice. Extracellular perfusion ofmiR- induces TRPA currents in both Trpa-expressing heterologous cells andnative sensory neurons through the core sequence GGGACCC. Computer simulationsreveal that the core sequence binds several residues at the extracellular S-Sloop of TRPA, which are critical for TRPA activation by miR- but not allylisothiocyanate. Intradermal inoculation of human Myla cells induces lymphoma andchronic itch in immune-deficient mice, associated with increased serum levels ofmiR-, secreted from cancer cells. Lymphoma-induced chronic itch is suppressedby miR- inhibitor and a blocking peptide that disrupts the miR-/TRPAinteraction.

Inthe  American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau reported there wereclose to . million Arab Americans living within the United States, a %increase in population size from . According to the Arab American Institute,currently, that estimate has grown to approximately . million. They have highrates of smoking and low rates of smoking cessation. In this study, theresearchers investigated factors influencing desire to quit smoking among ArabAmericans, and their association with acculturation and health beliefs.METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional descriptive study investigating smoking behaviorsand factors influencing the desire to quit smoking among adult Arab American.Data were collected to measure tobacco use, nicotine dependence, desire to quitsmoking, acculturation, and health beliefs.RESULTS: The sample ( N = ) was % female, mean age of  years (Â±.). Thedesire to quit smoking was positively associated with perceived severity (p <.) and susceptibility to cancer (p < .), perceived benefits of quittingsmoking ( p < .); and negatively associated with smoking barriers (addictionbarriers p < ., external barriers p = ., internal barriers p < .), andnicotine dependence (p < .). Being female, having a lower level of nicotinedependence, and a higher perception of cancer severity predicted higher desire toquit smoking ( p < .).DISCUSSION: Smoking cessation intervention studies need to target appropriatehealth beliefs, especially the high risk of cancer caused by smoking among ArabAmericans."

" University of Illinois","Multivalent Binding and Biomimetic Cell Rolling Improves the Sensitivity andSpecificity of Circulating Tumor Cell Capture.","Purpose: We aimed to examine the effects of multivalent binding and biomimeticcell rolling on the sensitivity and specificity of circulating tumor cell (CTC)capture. We also investigated the clinical significance of CTCs and their kineticprofiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.ExperimentalDesign: Patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoingradiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.Peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, includingbefore radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, aswell as  to  weeks after completion of radiotherapy. CTC capture wasaccomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (CapioCyte) functionalized withaEpCAM, aHER-, and aEGFR.Results: CapioCyte was able to detect CTCs in all cancer patients enrolled. Multivalent binding via poly(amidoamine) dendrimersfurther improved capture sensitivity. We also showed that cell rolling effect canimprove CTC capture specificity (% of captured cells that are CK+/CD-/DAPI+) upto %.

We also investigated the clinical significance of CTCs and their kineticprofiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.ExperimentalDesign: Patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoingradiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.Peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, includingbefore radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, aswell as  to  weeks after completion of radiotherapy. CTC capture wasaccomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (CapioCyte) functionalized withaEpCAM, aHER-, and aEGFR.Results: CapioCyte was able to detect CTCs in all cancer patients enrolled.

However, few studies to date have examinedwhether trajectories of CVD risk and major risk factors are worse among womenwith a breast cancer diagnosis compared with those without.METHODS: Changes in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic bloodpressure, and -year CVD risk were compared between women with ( women) andwithout ( women) an incident breast cancer diagnosis while they were enrolledin the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Sister Study cohort.Blood pressure and adiposity measures were collected by trained examiners at anenrollment visit (â¥ year before breast cancer diagnosis) and a second home visit to  years later (â¥ year after breast cancer diagnosis). Thenon-laboratory-based Framingham risk score, a measure of -year general CVDrisk, was calculated at both the enrollment and second visits. All analyses werestratified by menopausal status at the time of enrollment.RESULTS: Women who were premenopausal at the time of enrollment experiencedmoderate increases in weight, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, andCVD risk over the study period. Those who were postmenopausal at the time ofenrollment demonstrated little change in weight, but were found to have increasesin waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and CVD risk. In both groups,changes over time did not differ significantly according to breast cancer status.Neither chemotherapy nor endocrine therapy were found to be associated withgreater increases in CVD risk or risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: In the current study cohort, changes over time in CVD risk,adiposity measures, and blood pressure were similar between women who developedan incident breast cancer and those who did not."

Evidence regarding the barriers impeding access tocomprehensive palliative care is dispersed in the literature, and evidencespecific to pediatric oncology remains particularly sparse. The purpose of thecurrent review was to synthesize the existing literature regarding these barriersand the strategies offered to address them. The authors completed a literaturesearch using the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature(CINAHL), and Web of Science databases. In total,  articles were reviewed.Barriers to accessing pediatric palliative care were categorized according to the levels of a modified socioecological model (ie, barriers related topolicy/payment, health systems, organizations, and individuals). Major themesidentified at each level included: ) the lack of consistent and adequate fundingmechanisms at the policy/payment level, ) the lack of pediatric palliative careprograms and workforce at the health systems level, ) difficulties integratingpalliative care into existing pediatric oncology care models at theorganizational level, and ) the lack of knowledge about pediatric palliativecare, discomfort with talking about death, and cultural differences betweenproviders and patients and their families at the individual level.Recommendations to address each of the barriers identified in the literature areincluded.

" Duke University Medical Center","A Phase I Trial of the PIK Inhibitor Buparlisib Combined With Capecitabine inPatients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.","BACKGROUND: Buparlisib is an oral pan-class I phosphotidyinositol--kinase (PIK)inhibitor. The present phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, andefficacy of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breastcancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received buparlisib once daily (range,  to mg) for  weeks with capecitabine twice daily (range,  to  mg/m) for weeks with a -week break. Dose escalation used a traditional ""Â + "" design withstandard definitions of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose.RESULTS: Of the  patients enrolled,  were evaluable for DLT and  wereevaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination wasbuparlisib  mg daily and capecitabine  mg/m twice daily. DLTs includedgrade  hyperglycemia and grade  confusion. The most common grade  toxicitieswere diarrhea and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alaninetransaminase. One patient exhibited a complete response to treatment and four hada confirmed partial response. In cohorts  and , in which the buparlisib doseremained constant but the capecitabine dose was increased, significant increasesin the buparlisib plasma concentration were noted.CONCLUSION: The combination of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients withmetastatic breast cancer was generally well-tolerated, with several patientsdemonstrating prolonged responses. Unexpectedly low rates of PIKCA mutations (of ) were seen, and only  of  tumors with subtyping were luminal, makingexploration of these putative predictive markers impossible. Further study of thecombination is not unreasonable, with expanded pharmacokinetics and sequencinganalysis to better elucidate potential drug-drug interactions and more accuratepredictive biomarkers of response."

" Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry","Synergistic and low adverse effect cancer immunotherapy by immunogenicchemotherapy and locally expressed PD-L trap.","Although great success has been obtained inÂ the clinic, the current immunecheckpoint inhibitors still face two challenging problems: low response rate andimmune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Here we report the combination ofimmunogenic chemotherapy and locally expressed PD-L trap fusion protein forefficacious and safe cancer immunotherapy. We demonstrate that oxaliplatin (OxP)boosts anti-PD-L mAb therapy against murine colorectal cancer. By design of aPD-L trap and loading its coding plasmid DNA into a lipid-protamine-DNAnanoparticle, PD-L trap is produced transiently and locally in the tumormicroenvironment, and synergizes with OxP for tumor inhibition. Significantly,unlike the combination of OxP and anti-PD-L mAb, the combination of OxP andPD-L trap does not induce obvious Th cells accumulation in the spleen,indicating better tolerance and lower tendency to irAEs.

" The Ohio State University","Chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting: association with NF-ÎºB and cancer cachexia.","A compounding feature of greater than % of all cancers is the high incidence ofthe cachexia syndrome, a complex metabolic disorder characterized by extremeweight loss due mainly to the gross depletion of skeletal muscle tissue. Althoughstudies into the cause of cancer cachexia has spanned over multiple decades,little is known about the effects of various cancer treatments themselves oncachexia. For example, chemotherapy agents induce side effects such as nausea andanorexia, but these symptoms do not fully account for the changes seen withcancer cachexia. In this study we examine the effects of chemotherapeuticcompounds, specifically, cisplatin in the colon- adenocarcinoma model of cancercachexia. We find that although cisplatin is able to reduce tumor burden asexpected, muscle wasting in mice nevertheless persists. Strikingly, cisplatinalone was seen to regulate muscle atrophy, which was independent of the commonlyimplicated ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, we show that cisplatin is ableto induce NF-ÎºB activity in both mouse muscles and myotube cultures, suggestingthat an additional side effect of cancer treatment is the regulation of musclewasting that may be mediated through activation of the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway."

" Washington University","Oral tongue carcinoma among young patients: An analysis of risk factors andsurvival.","INTRODUCTION: The incidence of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) inyounger adults has rapidly increased over the past two decades. While tobacco andalcohol use may be less likely to cause these tumors, it remains controversialwhether differences also exist in their prognosis. Our aim is to examine the riskfactors for cancer among young (<â¯years old) OTSCC patients at our institution,and to compare their recurrence and survival with older patients in a matchedcohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All OTSCC patients seen at our institution between and  were reviewed. Patients under  who with sufficient treatmentinformation were matched : on race, T-stage, and N-stage with patients  andolder. Three-year recurrence and survival were determined in stratified andadjusted Cox regression models.RESULTS: Of  OTSCC patients were seen at our institution,  (%) were lessthan â¯years old. Younger patients were significantly more likely to be female,(% vs. %; pâ¯=â¯.) and to abstain from tobacco (% vs. %; pâ¯<â¯.).Young patients in the matched cohort were significantly more likely to have arecurrence (HR . % CI .-.). There was no difference in overall survival.CONCLUSION: Younger OTSCC patients in a matched cohort were more likely to recurwithin â¯years, although there was no difference in overall mortality.Differences in risk factors and recurrence between older and younger patientssuggest that some cancer among younger patients may be distinct from traditionalOTSCC."

" Dana-Farber Cancer Institute","TP protein levels, RNA-based pathway assessment, and race among invasive breastcancer cases.","Mutations in tumor suppressor TP have been inconsistently linked to breastcancer risk factors and survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, a primaryclinical means of TP mutation determination, only detects mutations thatfacilitate protein accumulation (e.g., missense mutations). RNA-based pathwaymethods capture functional status and may aid in understanding the role of TPfunction in racial disparities of breast cancer. TP status was assessed amonginvasive breast cancer cases from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS)(-) using IHC and an established RNA-based TP signature (CBCS and TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)). Frequency of TP status (IHC, RNA-based) wasestimated in association with tumor characteristics, PAM intrinsic subtype,age, and race using relative frequency differences (RFDs) and % confidenceintervals (% CI) as the measure of association. Approximately % of basal-liketumors were TP protein positive (IHC), while nearly % were TP mutant-like(RNA). Luminal A tumors had low frequency of TP positivity (IHC: .%) andmutant-like status (RNA: .%). Mutant-like TP (RNA) was strongly associatedwith age â¤ years, high tumor grade, advanced stage of disease, large tumorsize, and basal-like and HER intrinsic subtypes. Black race was stronglyassociated with TP mutant-like status (RNA) (RFD: .%, % CI: ., .)even after adjusting for age, grade, stage (RFD: .%; % CI: ., .).Associations were attenuated and non-significant when measured by IHC. IHC-basedTP status is an insensitive measurement of TP functional status. RNA-basedmethods suggest a role for TP in tumor prognostic features and racialdisparities."

All scans were reviewedby a dedicated neuroradiologist with subspecialty expertise in head and neckimaging. Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion to the genioglossus,hyoglossus, medial pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles was analyzed. Local andregional recurrence rates were compared between the muscle invasion and no muscleinvasion groups.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients met inclusion criteria with adequatefollow-up data and pretreatment imaging. Patients were predominantly male (.%male) and smokers (.% smokers) with a mean age of . (standard deviation:. years). Most commonly invaded muscles in the muscle invasion group werehyoglossus (.%) and genioglossus (.%). There was no statisticallysignificant difference in primary site or nodal recurrence between the combinedgroup, including definite or possible muscle invasion and the group withoutmuscle invasion (Pâ=â. and Pâ=â., respectively). Additionally, nostatistically significant difference was present in recurrence-free anddisease-specific survival between the two groups at - and -year follow-up(Pâ>â.).CONCLUSION: Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion does not appear to be apredictor of human papilloma virus (+) OPSCC recurrence.

" University of Texas Health Sciences Centerat San Antonio","Use of lung treatment plans to evaluate DIR algorithms.","The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of two deformable imageregistration algorithms by examining their influence on the dose summationresults obtained using DCT (four dimensional computed tomography) dosedistributions based on 'D' planned and 'D optimal' IMRT (intensity modulatedradiation therapy) plans. For ten lung cancer patients, D step and shoot IMRTplans were produced. The breathing cycle was divided into ten parts and for eachpart a set of CT images was acquired. For each patient the treatment plan wascopied to the CTs of each phase and subsequently recalculated. Each phase CT wasthen registered to the average intensity projection (AIP) CT using a deformableimage registration (DIR) algorithm and the composite dose distribution was thencalculated by summing up the deformed dose distributions from all the phases('D' treatment plan). The 'D optimal' treatment plan was created by producingan optimal plan on the CTs of each phase of the respiratory cycle and summing upthe deformed dose distributions from all the phases. The results indicate that itis possible to map the dose distributions of different breathing phases in lungusing DIR, and that different DIR methods and target characteristics (motionamplitude, size, location) affect the differences between original plan, 'D' and'D optimal' dose distributions. Although the 'D optimal' plans were designed toachieve % target coverage, both of the used DIR methods failed to translatethat coverage in some instances. The same variation between these methods wasalso observed in the 'D' plan comparison. This study shows that it is feasibleto perform an acceptably accurate calculation of the composite deformed dose.However, it is important to account for tumor motion and body deformationespecially when the tumor volume is small and/or located in the lower lobe of thelung."

"American Institutes for Research","Mental status evaluation in older adults with cancer: Development of the MentalHealth Index-.","OBJECTIVES: The Mental Health Index (MHI) is widely used as a measure of mentalhealth status, but has not been evaluated in the geriatric oncology population.This study evaluated the MHI- in a geriatric oncology population, to establishvalidity and scoring rules.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Carolina Senior Registry (NCT) was used toobtain data for  patients with cancer  and older who completed the MHI-.The -item patient-reported measure produces one total score summing across fourdomains: anxiety, depression, positive affect, and sense of belonging. Cronbach'salpha (Î±), confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), item-response theory (IRT)analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses were used to evaluateinternal consistency and validity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The revised MHI retained the  best-fitting items fromthe MHI- and resulted in a final model that included two subscales: anxiety(four items, RMSEA .; CFI .; TLI .) and depression ( items, RMSEA .;CFI .; TL .). IRT analyses of the four anxiety items indicated good fit(RMSEA .) and precise measurement of adults with poor mental health, and thenine depression items also fit well (RMSEA .). No meaningful differences werefound by sex, education, or treatment stage. Scores were developed to providemeaningful norms. The new MHI- is a shorter, more accurate way to assess mentalhealth in older adults with cancer and most importantly allows clinicians toseparately identify anxiety and/or depression - a clinically importantdistinction as treatment differs among these two types of mental healthimpairment."
" Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Overall survival time prediction for high-grade glioma patients based onlarge-scale brain functional networks.","High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer with poor outcome. Accuratepreoperative overall survival (OS) time prediction for HGG patients is crucialfor treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS predictionstudies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on themagnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the highly complex lesion MRIappearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurateindividualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namelybrain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-statefunctional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional networkswhere the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesionappearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics featurescould capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated withprognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse representation withregional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional connectivity (FC) networks(characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamicsFC time courses). Then, we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networksfor a jointly, machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on apreliminary dataset (Nâ=â with bad OS, mean OS, ~Â days; Nâ=â with good OS,mean OS, ~Â days), we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy (.%) onseparating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS. However, if usingonly conventionally derived descriptive features (e.g., age and tumorcharacteristics), the accuracy is low (.%). Our study highlights theimportance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional connectomics for treatmentplanning."

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to study theefflux of d-luciferin potassium salt, the substrate of ATP-binding cassettetransporters (ABC transporters), in MCF-/DOX cells treated by Î²-ELE. At the sametime three major ABC transport proteins and genes-related MDR, P-glycoprotein(P-gp, ABCB) and multidrug resistance-associated protein  (MRP, ABCC) as wellas breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG) were analyzed by q-PCR andWestern blot. To investigate the efflux functionality of ABC transporters,MCF-/DOXFluc cell line with stably-overexpressed luciferase was established. BLIwas then used to real-time monitor the efflux kinetics of d-luciferin potassiumsalt before and after MCF-/DOXFluc cells being treated with Î²-ELE or not. Theresults showed that the efflux of d-luciferin potassium salt from MCF-/DOXFlucwas lessened when pretreated with Î²-ELE, which means that Î²-ELE may dampen thefunctionality of ABC transporters, thus decrease the efflux of d-fluoresceinpotassium or other chemotherapies which also serve as the substrates of ABCtransporters. As the effect of Î²-ELE on the expression of ABC transporters, theresults of q-PCR and Western blot showed that gene and protein expression of ABCtransporters such as P-gp, MRP, and BCRP were down-regulated after the treatmentof Î²-ELE. To verify the efficacy of Î²-ELE on reversing MDR, MCF-/DOX cells weretreated with the combination of DOX and Î²-ELE. MTT assay showed that Î²-ELEincreased the inhibitory effect of DOX on the proliferation of MCF-/DOX, and theIC of the combination group was much lower than that of the single DOX or Î²-ELEtreatment.

Compared with men of other races andethnicities, African-American men have higher rates of mortality and morbidityfrom chronic illness and diseases including cancer, heart disease, prostatecancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. One way to address these disparities is to includeAfrican-American men in health research, to elicit their perspectives on healthrisks and protective factors. These can then inform interventions aimed atreducing health disparities. However, challenges remain in recruiting andengaging African-American men in health research.AIM: To provide strategies for recruiting African-American men in healthresearch, using as an exemplar a qualitative study of fathers' perspectives ofsexual health promotion with young African-American males.DISCUSSION: Efforts are needed to increase the representation of African-Americanmen in health research. Ensuring that researchers are aware of the cultural,social and environmental factors related to decisions to participate in researchcan lead to effective methods to recruit and engage them.CONCLUSION: There are several essential strategies for increasingAfrican-American men's participation in health research: ensuring the researchteam is culturally and gender-sensitive; recruiting in trusted environments;using respected gatekeepers; developing trust with participants; and beingtransparent.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Implementing strategies to include African-Americanmen in health research has the potential to improve health disparities in the US."

" Federal University of Sao Paulo","Antireflux Surgery and Barrett's Esophagus: Myth or Reality?","BACKGROUND: It may seem questionable if antireflux surgery still has a role inthe management of patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) in the current era whenantireflux surgery is facing a steady decline, obesity is increasing,pharmacologic treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is in itssplendor, and endoscopic techniques are used more frequently. It is questionableif patients with BE should be operated to stop GERD and to prevent cancer. Theaim of this study was to determine the role of antireflux surgery in patientswith BE.METHODS: Literature review.RESULTS: The role of antireflux operations is, in fact, very controversial andneglected. BE is a different phenotype of GERD with a distinct pathophysiologylinked to severe reflux of bile and acid, due to a marked anatomic disruption ofthe gastroesophageal barrier. Published series show that a fundoplicationadequately controls GERD and symptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or evenbetter a bile diversion antireflux procedure) may prevent esophagealadenocarcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a fundoplication efficiently controls GERD andsymptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or even better a bile diversionprocedure) may also prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma."

Two trained raters coded recorded videos of port starts from  children being treated for cancer. Thisincluded  children with two video-recorded port starts and  children withthree (T, T, T). The Parent Caring Response Scoring System derived fromSwanson's Caring Theory was used to code parent communication behaviors as caringresponses during their children's port starts. Three - to -minute slices(pre-port start, during, and post-port start) were coded for each video. Mixedmodeling with generalized estimating equations and Friedman test were used toanalyze longitudinal change in parent behaviors.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between T versus T in eye contact(Î² = -., p = .), distance-close-enough-to-touch (Î² = -., p = .),nonverbal comforting (Î² = -., p = .), and availability (Î² = -., p =.), suggesting that more parents used communication behaviors at T comparedwith T.

Mixedmodeling with generalized estimating equations and Friedman test were used toanalyze longitudinal change in parent behaviors.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between T versus T in eye contact(Î² = -., p = .), distance-close-enough-to-touch (Î² = -., p = .),nonverbal comforting (Î² = -., p = .), and availability (Î² = -., p =.), suggesting that more parents used communication behaviors at T comparedwith T. Parent burdensome or intrusive questions (e.g., Why do you cry? Î²Â =-., p = .) and nonverbal comforting (Î² = -., pÂ =Â .) increased from Tto T. The median values of parent communication behaviors overall had nosignificant changes from T to T.CONCLUSION: Parents adjusted to use more nonverbal caring behaviors as theirchild experienced additional port starts. Experimental studies should be designedto help parents use caring behaviors to better support their children duringcancer procedures."

" Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","Tuning Parameter Selection in Cox Proportional Hazards Model with a DivergingNumber of Parameters.","Regularized variable selection is a powerful tool for identifying the trueregression model from a large number of candidates by applying penalties to theobjective functions. The penalty functions typically involve a tuning parameterthat control the complexity of the selected model. The ability of the regularizedvariable selection methods to identify the true model critically depends on thecorrect choice of the tuning parameter. In this study we develop a consistenttuning parameter selection method for regularized Cox's proportional hazardsmodel with a diverging number of parameters. The tuning parameter is selected byminimizing the generalized information criterion. We prove that, for any penaltythat possesses the oracle property, the proposed tuning parameter selectionmethod identifies the true model with probability approaching one as sample sizeincreases. Its finite sample performance is evaluated by simulations. Itspractical use is demonstrated in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancerdata."
