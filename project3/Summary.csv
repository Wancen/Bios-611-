" Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry","Injectable Bioresponsive Gel Depot for Enhanced Immune Checkpoint Blockade.","Although cancer immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors holds greatpromise toward many types of cancers, several challenges still remain, associatedwith low objective response of patient rate as well as systemic side effects.Here, a combination immunotherapy strategy is developed based on a thermogellingreactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polypeptide gel for sustained release ofanti-programmed cell death-ligand  antibody and dextro--methyl tryptophan,inhibitor of indoleamine-,-dioxygenase with leveraging the ROS level in thetumor microenvironment. This bioresponsive gel depot can effectively reduce thelocal ROS level and facilitate release of immunotherapeutics, which leads toenhanced anti-melanoma efficacy in vivo."

Less is known about how family history of breastcancer impacts the association, and whether it varies by menopausal status.METHODS: The Sister Study is a cohort of , women who had a sister withbreast cancer, but no prior breast cancer themselves. Women reported allrecreational sport/exercise activities they participated in over the past months. Hours/week and MET-hours/week of physical activity were considered inassociation with breast cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HRs) and % confidenceintervals (CIs) were calculated with Cox regression. Extent of family history,examined as a modifier, was characterized by a Bayesian score incorporatingcharacteristics of the family structure.RESULTS: During follow-up (average . years), , cases were diagnosed. Higherhours/week (HR>=vs<=.; %CI: .-.) and MET-hours/week(HRquartilevs=.; %CI: .-.) of physical activity were associated withreduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Hours/week and MET-hours/week wereassociated with suggestive increased premenopausal breast cancer risk(MET-hours/week HRquartilevs=.; %CI: .-.). Associations did not varywith extent of family history. However, the increased risk in premenopausal womenmay be limited to those with stronger family history.CONCLUSIONS: In women with a family history of breast cancer, physical activitywas associated with reduced postmenopausal, but not premenopausal, breast cancerrisk and was not modified by extent of family history.IMPACT: This was the first study to examine the association between physicalactivity and breast cancer risk in a large population with a family history ofbreast cancer."

" Ponce Health Sciences University","Effects of histone methyltransferase inhibition in endometriosis.","Although the histone methyltransferase EZH and its product HKme are wellstudied in cancer, little is known about their role and potential as therapeutictargets in endometriosis. We have previously reported that endometriotic lesionsare characterized by global enrichment of HKme. Therefore, we aimed to ()characterize the expression levels of EZH in endometriotic tissues; () assessHKme enrichment in candidate genes promoter regions; and () determine ifpharmacological inhibition of EZH impacts migration, proliferation, and invasionof endometriotic cells. Immunohistochemistry of an endometriosis-focused tissuemicroarray was used to assess the EZH protein levels in tissues. Chromatinimmunoprecipitation-qPCR was conducted to assess enrichment of HKme incandidate gene promoter regions in tissues. Immunofluorescence was performed toassess the effect of an EZH-specific pharmacological inhibitor on HKmeglobal enrichment in cell lines. To measure effects of the inhibitor inmigration, proliferation, and invasion in vitro we used Scratch, BrdU, andMatrigel assays, respectively. Endometriotic lesions had significantly higherEZHα nuclear immunostaining levels compared to eutopic endometrium from patients(glands, stroma) and controls (glands). HKme was enriched within promoterregions of candidate genes in some but not all of the endometriotic lesions.Inhibition of EZH reduced HKme levels in the endometriotic cellsspecifically, and also reduced migration, proliferation but not invasion ofendometriotic epithelial cells (Z). These findings support future preclinicalstudies to determine in vivo efficacy of EZH inhibitors as promising nonhormonaltreatments for endometriosis, still an incurable gynecological disease."

The nanocapsule consists of a drug-silica complexfilling and a solid silica sheath, and it is designed to minimally release drugmolecules in the early hours of cell entry. While taken up by macrophages at highrates, the nanocapsules minimally affect cell migration in the first - h,buying time for macrophages to home to tumors and release drugs in situ.

"The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins","Do older patients with non-small cell lung cancer also benefit from first-lineplatinum-based doublet chemotherapy? Observations from a pooled analysis of prospectively-treated patients (Alliance Study A).","OBJECTIVE: This study sought to define the role of first-line platinum-baseddoublet chemotherapy in older patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed three first-line NSCLC trials: CALGB ,CALGB , and CALGB , which tested carboplatin and paclitaxel;carboplatin and gemcitabine; and carboplatin with either pemetrexed orgemcitabine, respectively. Overall survival was the primary endpoint. Age-basedcomparisons with a cutpoint of  years were performed with Cox proportionalhazards models with adjustments for sex, tumor histology, cancer stage,chemotherapy, and smoking history and after stratifying by performance score.Secondary endpoints were grade - adverse events, chemotherapy cycles completed,and whether toxicity prompted chemotherapy discontinuation.RESULTS:  patients were included;  (%) were + years of age. Nostatistically significant difference in survival was observed for older (≥)versus younger patients (HR = .; % CI = (., .); p = .). A trendemerged with increased odds of a grade - adverse event for patients ≥ yearsversus < years (OR = .; % CI = (., .); p = .). The proportion ofcompleted chemotherapy cycles was marginally lower in older patients(difference = -%; % CI = (-, .); p = .) for those ≥ years versus< years, but no statistically significant difference occurred in the rate ofchemotherapy discontinuation for toxicity (OR = .; % CI = (., .);p = .) for patients ≥ years versus < years.

We simultaneously derived shared andstudy-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-studyfactor analysis applied to  nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and %confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined,and larynx, from logistic regression models.RESULTS: We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible acrossstudies (% variance explained): the Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber (OR=.,CI: .-., highest vs. lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR=., CI:.-.) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancerrisk. The Animal products and cereals (OR=., CI: .-.) and the Fats (OR=.,CI: .-.) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk,whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for theAnti-oxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additionalstudy-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined.

" University of Liverpool","Covalent inhibitors of EGFR family protein kinases induce degradation of humanTribbles  (TRIB) pseudokinase in cancer cells.","A major challenge associated with biochemical and cellular analysis ofpseudokinases is a lack of target-validated small-molecule compounds with whichto probe function. Tribbles  (TRIB) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with adiverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There issubstantial evidence that human TRIB promotes survival and drug resistance insolid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutictarget. The unusual TRIB pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-richC-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminaltail, which also supports its interaction with E ubiquitin ligases. We foundthat TRIB is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinaseinhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinasedomains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Usinga thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB-binding compounds within the PublishedKinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classifycompounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB in vitro. TRIBdestabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIBdegradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signalingand survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development ofTRIB-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling thecellular mechanisms of TRIB-based signaling. Our study highlights that smallmolecule-induced protein down-regulation through drug ""off-targets"" might berelevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases."

Single-center studies have reportedinferior outcomes in patients with a complex karyotype (CK), but this remains anarea of controversy.METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed  patients from  academiccenters in the United States and described the effect of a CK on survivaloutcomes in individuals with MCL.RESULTS: A CK was found to be associated with inferior overall survival (OS) (.vs . years; P<.) and progression-free survival (PFS) (. vs . years;P<.). In patients who underwent high-intensity induction followed by autologousstem cell transplantation (ASCT) in first remission, a CK was associated withpoor OS (. vs . years; P = .) and PFS (. vs . years; P<.). Amongpatients with a CK, high-intensity induction had no effect on OS (. vs .years; P = .) nor PFS (. vs . years; P = .). Similarly, ASCT in firstremission did not improve PFS (. vs . years; P = .) nor OS (. vs .years; P = .). On multivariable analyses with Ki- and MIPI, only CK was foundto be predictive of OS (hazard ratio [HR], .; % confidence interval [%CI], .-. [P = .]), whereas both CK (HR, .; % CI, .-. [P =.]) and Ki- >% (HR, .; % CI, .-. [P = .]) were associated withinferior PFS. Multivariable analysis did not identify any specific cytogeneticabnormalities associated with inferior survival.CONCLUSIONS: CK appears to be independently associated with inferior outcomes inpatients with MCL regardless of the intensity of induction therapy and receipt ofASCT. Cytogenetics should be incorporated into the workup of a new diagnosis ofMCL and novel therapeutic approaches should be investigated for patients with CK.Cancer ;:-. ©  American Cancer Society."

" Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School","Classifying medical histories in US Medicare beneficiaries using fixed vsall-available look-back approaches.","PURPOSE: Evaluate use of fixed and all-available look-backs to identifyeligibility criteria and confounders among Medicare beneficiaries.METHODS: We identified outpatient visits (-) with recently documented(≤ days) cardiovascular risk and classified patients according to whether theexposure (statin) was initiated within  days. We selected each beneficiary'sfirst eligible visit (in each treatment group) that met criteria during therespective look-backs: continuous enrollment ( or  years for fixed look-back; days for all-available), no cancer history, and no statin claims. Weestimated crude and standardized mortality ratio weighted hazard ratios (HRs) forthe effect of statin initiation on incident -month cancer (a known null effect)and -year mortality, separately, adjusting for covariates assessed by using eachlook-back.RESULTS: Analyzing short-term cancer, the estimated HR from the all-availableapproach (HR = ., % CI: ., .) was less biased than the -yearlook-back (HR = ., % CI: ., .), which included beneficiaries withprevalent cancer. The -year look-back (HR = ., % CI: ., .) wassomewhat less biased than the all-available estimate but less precise due theexclusion of a large proportion of observations without sufficient continuousenrollment (.% and .% of initiators and non-initiators, respectively). Allapproaches produced similar estimates of the effect on all-cause mortality.Alternative look-backs did not differ in their ability to control confounding.CONCLUSIONS: The all-available look-back performed nearly as well as the -yearfixed, which produced the least biased point estimate. If -year look-backs areinfeasible (eg, due to power/sample), all-available look-backs may be preferableto short (-year) fixed look-backs."

In -, before the VLNC proposal became public, thesesmokers took part in an online survey. We used multivariate weighted analyses tocalculate ORs and percentages and a χ test to examine the association betweenvariables.RESULTS: Overall, .% of smokers believed that smoking VLNC cigarettes for years would be less likely to cause cancer than smoking current cigarettes. Thismisperception was more common among smokers who were aged above  (.%) andblack (.%). Additionally, .% of smokers reported they would be less likelyto quit if the USA adopted a VLNC standard. Thinking that VLNC cigarettes wouldbe less carcinogenic was associated with smokers reporting they would be lesslikely to quit (P<.).CONCLUSIONS: Many smokers had the misperception that smoking VLNC cigarettes isless likely to cause cancer, and some stated that they would be less likely toquit. A VLNC standard may be more effective if accompanied by a communicationcampaign that emphasises the continued dangers of smoking VLNC cigarettes due tothe many toxic chemicals in smoke."

" Kumamoto University","Differential Roles of Rad and Chk in Genome Maintenance and SkinCarcinogenesis Following UV Exposure.","Defects in DNA polymerase Eta (Polη) cause the sunlight-sensitivity and skincancer-propensity disorder xeroderma pigmentosum variant. The extent to whichPolη function depends on the upstream E ubiquitin ligase Rad is controversialand has not been investigated using mouse models. Therefore, we tested the roleof Rad in UV-inducible skin tumorigenesis. Because Rad deficiency leads tocompensatory DNA damage signaling by Chk, we also investigated geneticinteractions between Rad and Chk in vivo. Chk-/-Rad-/- mice were prone tospontaneous lymphomagenesis. Both Chk-/- and Chk-/-Rad-/- mice were prone toUV-B irradiation-induced skin tumorigenesis when compared with wild-type (WT)animals, but unexpectedly Rad-/- mice did not recapitulate the skin tumorpropensity of Polη mutants. UV-irradiated Rad-/- cells were more susceptible toG/S arrest and apoptosis than WT cultures. Chk deficiency alleviated bothUV-induced G/S phase arrest and apoptosis of WT and Rad-/- cells, but led toincreased genomic instability. Taken together, our results demonstrate that thetumor-suppressive role of Polη in UV-treated skin is Rad independent.

" China Pharmaceutical University","Immune lipoprotein nanostructures inspired relay drug delivery for amplifyingantitumor efficiency.","Chemo-immunotherapy represents an appealing approach to improving cancertreatment. Simultaneously administrating chemotherapeutics with immunoadjuvantscan elicit potent tumor death and immune responses. Herein, high densitylipoprotein (HDL) inspired immune lipoprotein was proposed for relay drugdelivery and amplifying antitumor therapy. Lipophilic ASaptamer-immunoadjuvant CpG fused sequences (Apt-CpG-DSPE) were conjugated tofacilitate decoration onto HDLs; and doxorubicin (Dox) was successivelyintercalated into the consecutive base pairs of Apt-CpG to complete immune HDLnanodrug imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox. For relay drug delivery, imHDL/Apt-CpG-Dox underwentsite-specific structure collapse in tumor intercellular substances inspired fromHDL biofunctions (sequential module I); subsequently, dissociated Apt-CpG-Dox wasendocytosed into tumor cells mediated by the recognition of AS and nucleolin(sequential module II), translocating Dox to nucleus and enabling tumor ablationand antigens release. The liberated CpG motif further evoked antigen recognition,induced vast secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentiated hostantitumor immunity. Our studies demonstrated that HDL biomimetic platform basedrelay drug delivery strategy outperformed the monotherapy counterparts inmalignant tumor models, eventually generating an augmented antitumor efficacy."
" and RTI International","Strategies for Successful Survivorship Care Plan Implementation: Results From aQualitative Study.","INTRODUCTION: Care for US cancer survivors is often fragmented, contributing topoor health outcomes. Care and outcomes may improve when survivors and follow-upcare providers receive survivorship care plans (SCPs), written documentscontaining information regarding cancer diagnosis, treatment, surveillance plans,and health promotion. However, implementing SCPs is challenging. As such, wesought to identify strategies for successfully implementing SCPs.METHODS: We measured SCP implementation using performance data from cancerprograms participating in the American Society of Clinical Oncology QualityOncology Practice Initiative, an oncologist-led quality assessment andimprovement program. We used semistructured interviews with cancer programemployees (eg, physicians) to identify strategies for successfully implementingSCPs by comparing approaches in cancer programs that, according to QualityOncology Practice Initiative performance indicators, developed and delivered SCPsto a relatively small proportion of eligible survivors and their follow-up careproviders (ie, low performers; n =  participants in five programs) withapproaches among programs with better performance (ie, moderate performers; n = participants in nine programs).RESULTS: Ten of  cancer programs developed SCPs for ≥ % of eligiblesurvivors; two of  delivered SCPs to any survivors; and eight of  deliveredSCPs to ≥ % of follow-up care providers. We found that moderate performersproactively addressed SCP requirements, leveraged requirements to improvesurvivorship care, set internal targets, automated implementation, had activeleaders and champions, and tasked appropriate employees with SCP implementation.CONCLUSION: SCP implementation remains challenging. We identified strategies forsuccessfully implementing SCPs. Future research should examine how cancerprograms have achieved these strategies; findings could contribute to anunderstanding of the changes needed to implement comprehensive survivorship care."

We examined eachstate separately for evidence of disparities within states, to avoid confoundingby geographic disparities.

" North Carolina State University","Direct nanodrug delivery for tumor targeting subject to shear-augmented diffusionin blood flow.","The advent of multifunctional nanoparticle has enabled numerous innovativestrategies in diagnostics, imaging, and cancer therapy. Despite the intenseresearch efforts in developing new nanoparticles and surface bonding ligands, onemajor obstacle in achieving highly effective treatment, including minimizingdetrimental side effects, is the inability to deliver drug-carrying nanoparticlesfrom the injection point directly to the tumor site. The present study seeks toemploy a direct nanodrug delivery methodology to feed multifunctionalnanoparticles directly to tumor vasculatures, sparing healthy tissue. Animportant aspect to examine is how the interactions between such nanoparticlesand relatively large red blood cells would affect the transport and deliveryefficiency of nanodrugs. So, a novel computer simulation model has been developedto study nanoparticle transport in a representative human hepatic artery system,subject to shear-induced diffusion of nanoparticles due to hydrodynamicinteractions with red blood cells. The particle-size effect was also evaluated bycomparing the dynamics of nanoparticles with microspheres. Results from computersimulations under physiologically realistic conditions indicate thatshear-induced diffusion has a significant effect on nanoparticle transport, evenin large arteries. Nevertheless, as documented, direct nanodrug delivery totumor-feeding hepatic artery branches is feasible.

In vitro studies showed that theantibody-photosensitizer conjugates specifically bind to Pgp-expressing drugresistant cancer cells, and caused dramatic cytotoxicity upon irradiation with anear infrared light. We then tested our Pgp-targeted approach in mouse xenograftmodels of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In both models,targeted PDT produced rapid tumor shrinkage, and significantly prolonged survivalof tumor-bearing mice. We conclude that our targeted PDT approach producesmolecularly targeted and spatially selective ablation of chemoresistant tumors,and thereby provides an effective approach to overcome Pgp-mediated multidrugresistance in cancer, where conventional approaches have failed."
" Trinity College Dublin","The pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue: current controversies.","Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating cancer symptoms, and isassociated with impaired quality of life. The exact pathophysiology ofcancer-related fatigue (CRF) is poorly understood, but in any individual, it islikely multifactorial and involves inter-related cytokine, muscular,neurotransmitter, and neuroendocrine changes. Underlying CRF mechanisms proposedinclude central and peripheral hypotheses. Central mechanisms include hypothesesabout cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis disruption,circadian rhythm disruption, serotonin, and vagal afferent nerve function whileperipheral mechanisms include hypotheses about adenosine triphosphate and musclecontractile properties. Currently, these hypotheses are largely based on evidencefrom other conditions in which fatigue is characteristic. The purpose of thisarticle is to provide a narrative review of the literature and present thecurrent controversies in the pathophysiology of CRF, particularly in relation tocentral and peripheral hypotheses for CRF. An understanding of pathophysiologymay facilitate direct and simple therapeutic interventions for those with cancer."

KSHV haslatent and lytic phases of the viral life cycle, and while both contribute toviral pathogenesis, lytic proteins contribute to KSHV-mediated oncogenesis.Reactivation from latency is driven by the KSHV lytic gene transactivator RTA,and RTA transcription is controlled by epigenetic modifications. To identify hostchromatin-modifying proteins that are involved in the latent to lytic transition,we screened a panel of inhibitors that target epigenetic regulatory proteins fortheir ability to stimulate KSHV reactivation. We found several novel regulatorsof viral reactivation: an inhibitor of Bmi, PTC-, two additional histonedeacetylase inhibitors, Romidepsin and Panobinostat, and the bromodomaininhibitor (+)-JQ. All of these compounds stimulate lytic gene expression, viralgenome replication, and release of infectious virions. Treatment with Romidepsin,Panobinostat, and PTC- induces histone modifications at the RTA promoter, andresults in nucleosome depletion at this locus. Finally, silencing Bmi inducesKSHV reactivation, indicating that Bmi, a member of the Polycomb repressivecomplex , is critical for maintaining KSHV latency."

" University of Washington","Patient-centered prioritization of bladder cancer research.","BACKGROUND: Patient-centered research requires the meaningful involvement ofpatients and caregivers throughout the research process. The objective of thisstudy was to create a process for sustainable engagement for researchprioritization within oncology.METHODS: From December  to , a network of engaged patients for researchprioritization was created in partnership with the Bladder Cancer AdvocacyNetwork (BCAN): the BCAN Patient Survey Network (PSN). The PSN leveraged anonline bladder cancer community with additional recruitment through printadvertisements and social media campaigns. Prioritized research questions weredeveloped through a modified Delphi process and were iterated throughmultidisciplinary working groups and a repeat survey.RESULTS: In year  of the PSN,  patients and caregivers responded to theresearch prioritization survey; the number of responses increased to  in year. The majority of respondents had non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC),and the mean time since diagnosis was  years. Stakeholder-identified questionsfor noninvasive, invasive, and metastatic disease were prioritized by the PSN.Free-text questions were sorted with thematic mapping. Several questionssubmitted by respondents were among the prioritized research questions. A finalprioritized list of research questions was disseminated to various fundingagencies, and a highly ranked NMIBC research question was included as a priorityarea in the  Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute announcement ofpragmatic trial funding.CONCLUSIONS: Patient engagement is needed to identify high-priority researchquestions in oncology. The BCAN PSN provides a successful example of anengagement infrastructure for annual research prioritization in bladder cancer.The creation of an engagement network sets the groundwork for additional phasesof engagement, including design, conduct, and dissemination.

" Virginia Commonwealth University","Role of Age, Tumor Grade, and Radiation Therapy on Immediate PostmastectomyBreast Reconstruction.","BACKGROUND: Despite the psychological benefits and oncologic safety ofpostmastectomy breast reconstruction, most breast cancer patients do not undergoreconstruction. To better understand the patterns of breast reconstruction usage,it is important to identify the clinicopathologic factors associated withimmediate breast reconstruction (IBR), and whether modification of thereconstruction incidence when stratified by patient- or cancer-related factorsexists in the breast cancer population. The primary objectives were to determinewhether the incidence of immediate postmastectomy breast reconstruction variesacross age, and whether the tumor grade or radiation therapy modify the effect ofage on the incidence of immediate breast reconstruction.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Resultsdatabase, we identified women who had undergone mastectomy for breast cancer from to . Inverse probability of treatment-weighted log-binomial regressionwas used to estimate the effect of age on IBR after accounting for potentialconfounding by patient demographic data and cancer characteristics. Potentialeffect measure modification by tumor grade and radiation therapy on the age-IBRrelationship was also assessed.RESULTS: Of , women, , (.%) had undergone IBR. Age wassignificantly associated with IBR prevalence (P < .), with younger women morelikely to undergo IBR. Both tumor grade (P < .) and radiation therapy (P <.) modified the effect of age on IBR.CONCLUSION: Compared with their older counterparts, younger breast cancerpatients were more likely to undergo IBR, and both tumor grade and radiationtherapy were differentially associated with the likelihood of IBR across patientage."

" Zhejiang University ","Enzyme-Responsive Charge-Reversal Polymer-Mediated Effective Gene Therapy forIntraperitoneal Tumors.","Gene therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in many genetic diseases, asevidenced by recent clinical applications. Viral vectors have been extensivelytested in clinical gene-therapy trials, but nonviral vectors such as cationicpolymers or lipids are much less used due to their lower gene-transfectionefficiencies. However, the advantages of nonviral vectors, such as easilytailored structures, nonimmunogenetics, and relatively low cost, still drivegreat efforts to improve their transfection efficiencies. A reverse question asksif nonviral vectors with current gene transfection efficiency can findapplication niches. Herein, we synthesized a cationic polymer, poly{N-[-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]- N-[ p-acetyloxyphenyl]- N, N-diethylammonium chloride}(PQDEA), as a gene-delivery carrier and compared it side by side withchemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment. PQDEA is rapidly hydrolyzed byintracellular esterases into anionic poly(acrylic acid) to give low cytotoxicityand fast release of DNA for expression. PQDEA formed stable complexes with DNA(PQDEA/DNA polyplexes), which were further coated with a lipid layer to makeserum-stable lipidic polyplexes, LPQDEA/DNAs, for in vivo use. In anintraperitoneal tumor xenograft model mimicking late-stage metastatic cervicalcancer, the LPQDEA/DNA vector with TRAIL suicide gene exerted strong tumorinhibition as effective as paclitaxel, the first-line anticancer drug, but gavemuch less tumor relapse and much longer survival than the clinical chemotherapydrugs, irinotecan and paclitaxel. Equally important, the gene therapy showed muchfewer adverse effects than the chemotherapy drugs. This work shows that nonviralvectors with current transfection efficiencies may produce therapeutic advantagesand may be safe and worthy of clinical translation in, for example,intraperitoneal cancer therapy."
" University of Chicago","PAM and Risk of Recurrence Scores for Interval Breast Cancers.","Breast cancers detected after a negative breast screening examination and priorto the next screening are referred to as interval cancers. These cancersgenerally have poor clinical characteristics compared with screen-detectedcancers, but associations between interval cancer and genomic cancercharacteristics are not well understood. Mammographically screened womendiagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer from  to  (n = ) wereidentified by linking the Carolina Breast Cancer Study and the CarolinaMammography Registry. Among women with a registry-identified screening mammogram to  months before diagnosis, cancers were classified as screen-detected (N =) or interval-detected (N = ). Using logistic regression, we examined theassociation of mode of detection with cancer characteristics (clinical, IHC, andgenomic), overall, and in analyses stratified on mammographic density and race.Interval cancer was associated with large tumors [> cm; OR, .; % confidenceinterval (CI), .-.], positive nodal status (OR, .; % CI, .-.), andtriple-negative subtype (OR, .; % CI, .-.). Interval cancers were morelikely to have non-Luminal A subtype (OR, .; % CI, .-.), whereasscreen-detected cancers tended to be more indolent (% had low risk ofrecurrence genomic scores; % were PAM Luminal A). When stratifying bymammographic density and race, associations between interval detection and poorprognostic features were similar by race and density status. Strong associationsbetween interval cancers and poor-prognosis genomic features (non-Luminal Asubtype and high risk of recurrence score) suggest that aggressive tumor biologyis an important contributor to interval cancer rates.

" Dana-Farber Cancer Institute","Image analysis with deep learning to predict breast cancer grade, ER status,histologic subtype, and intrinsic subtype.","RNA-based, multi-gene molecular assays are available and widely used for patientswith ER-positive/HER-negative breast cancers. However, RNA-based genomic testscan be costly and are not available in many countries. Methods for inferringmolecular subtype from histologic images may identify patients most likely tobenefit from further genomic testing. To identify patients who could benefit frommolecular testing based on H&E stained histologic images, we developed an imageanalysis approach using deep learning. A training set of  breast tumors wasused to create image-based classifiers for tumor grade, ER status, PAMintrinsic subtype, histologic subtype, and risk of recurrence score (ROR-PT). Theresulting classifiers were applied to an independent test set (n = ), andaccuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of each was assessed on the test set.Histologic image analysis with deep learning distinguished low-intermediate vs.high tumor grade (% accuracy), ER status (% accuracy), Basal-like vs.non-Basal-like (% accuracy), Ductal vs. Lobular (% accuracy), and high vs.low-medium ROR-PT score (% accuracy). Sampling considerations in the trainingset minimized bias in the test set. Incorrect classification of ER status wassignificantly more common for Luminal B tumors. These data provide proof ofprinciple that molecular marker status, including a critical clinical biomarker(i.e., ER status), can be predicted with accuracy >% based on H&E features.Image-based methods could be promising for identifying patients with a greaterneed for further genomic testing, or in place of classically scored variablestypically accomplished using human-based scoring."

Patients often rely on drug manufacturer-administeredPharmaceutical Assistance Programs (PAPs) to obtain drugs and reduced or no cost.The overall usage of PAPs within cancer care delivery is unknown. Methods Weincluded all cancer patients across an academically affiliated, integrated healthsystem in North Carolina during  ( N = ). We identified the subset ofpatients receiving PAP assistance to afford one or more cancer drugs, in order tocalculate the proportion of patients receiving PAP assistance, and the retailvalue of the assistance. Results Among  cancer patients,  unique patientssubmitted a total of  successful PAP requests for cancer drugs. % ofPAP-utilizing patients were uninsured, % had Medicaid coverage, % hadMedicare coverage, % were dual Medicare/Medicaid eligible, and % werecommercially insured. Among all cancer patients who received medical treatment,.% required PAP assistance, whereas .% receiving an oral agent required PAPassistance. The proportion receiving PAP assistance varied substantially by drug,ranging from <% of patients (e.g. carboplatin, methotrexate) to % of patients(e.g. ponatinib, temsirolimus). The majority of the retail value obtained was fororal agents, including $,, of imatinib and $,, of dasatinib, whichwere the two drugs with the highest aggregate retail value. Conclusions Asubstantial proportion of cancer patients receive private charitable assistanceto obtain standard-of-care treatments. This includes patients with federal andprivate insurance, suggesting an inability of patients to meet cost-sharingrequirements."

This study aims to develop and validate a model of factors associatedwith prior falls among older adults with cancer.METHODS: In this cross-sectional secondary analysis, two cohorts of patients aged≥  with cancer were examined to develop and validate a model of factorsassociated with falls in the prior  months. Potential independent variables,including demographic and laboratory data and a geriatric assessment(encompassing comorbidities, functional status, physical performance,medications, and psychosocial status), were identified.

" North Carolina Central University","Application of Integrated Drug Screening/Kinome Analysis to Identify Inhibitorsof Gemcitabine-Resistant Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth.","Continuous exposure of a pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa- (MiaS) togemcitabine resulted in the formation of a gemcitabine-resistant subline (MiaR).In an effort to discover kinase inhibitors that inhibited MiaR growth, MiaR cellswere exposed to kinase inhibitors (PKIS- library) in a -well screeningformat. Three compounds (UNCA, UNCA, and UNCA) wereidentified that inhibited the growth of MiaR cells by more than % (at  nM).Two compounds (UNCA and UNCA) were classified as cyclin-dependentkinase (CDK) inhibitors, whereas UNCA was reported to be a PLK inhibitor.Dose-response experiments supported the efficacy of these compounds to inhibitgrowth and increase apoptosis in D cultures of these cells. However, onlyUNCA significantly inhibited the growth of D spheroids composed of MiaRcells and GFP-tagged cancer-associated fibroblasts. Multiplexed inhibitor bead(MIB)-mass spectrometry (MS) kinome competition experiments identified CDK,CLK-, DYRKA, and CSNK as major kinase targets for UNCA in MiaR cells.Another CDK inhibitor (CDK-IN-) replicated the growth inhibitory effects ofUNCA, whereas inhibitors against the CLK, DYRK, or CSNK kinases had noeffect. In summary, these studies describe a coordinated approach to discovernovel kinase inhibitors, evaluate their efficacy in D models, and define theirspecificity against the kinome."

" University of Minnesota","Effective Message Elements for Disclosures About Chemicals in Cigarette Smoke.","Introduction: Cigarette smoke contains at least  chemicals or ""constituents""that the Food and Drug Administration has identified as harmful and potentiallyharmful constituents to human health. Our study sought to identify whichconstituent disclosure message elements are most effective in discouraging peoplefrom smoking.Methods: Three hundred eighty eight current smokers aged  and older completedan online survey in February . We randomized participants to respond to oneof two sets of  toxic products that contain cigarette constituents and health effects associated with cigarette constituents.Results: Products that elicited the most discouragement were those with lowerchances of exposure (e.g., explosives), followed by products with possibleexposure (e.g., rat poison), and products with a high likelihood of exposure(e.g., floor cleaner). Awareness of toxic products that constituents are found in(p < .) and low exposure products (p < .) were associated with higherdiscouragement. Health effects that people had heard are caused by cigarettesmoke constituents elicited higher discouragement from smoking cigarettes (p <.). Cancer was associated with higher discouragement relative to respiratory,cardiovascular, and reproductive health effects (all p < .).Conclusions: Cigarette smoke constituent messages may be more effective atdiscouraging smoking if they include information about carcinogenic healtheffects (e.g., mouth cancer and lung tumors) and low exposure toxic products(e.g., explosives and radioactive material) as message elements.Implications: Our study identified health effects and toxic products, especiallycancers and rarely encountered toxic products, that may discourage smoking whenincluded in disclosure messages. By constructing messages that communicate theharms associated with tobacco use by contextualizing those harms in terms ofspecific constituents, tobacco education messaging efforts may be increasinglysuccessful."
" University of California","Delivery Strategies for Immune Checkpoint Blockade.","Immune checkpoint blockade, which blocks the regulatory pathways that express onimmune cells to improve antitumor immunological responses, is becoming one of themost promising approaches for antitumor therapy. This therapy has achievedimportant clinical advancement and provided a new opportunity against a varietyof cancers. However, limitations of checkpoint inhibitors application, includingthe risk of autoimmune disease, low objective response rates, and high cost,still largely affect their broad applications in patients. Therefore, it isdesirable to seek effective delivery methods to further enhance the therapeuticefficacy and reduce drawbacks of immune checkpoint blockade. This brief reviewsummarizes strategies to increase the antitumor immunity, including the local andtargeted delivery of checkpoint inhibitors, and a combination of differentcheckpoint inhibitors or with other therapeutic treatments."
" Icahn School of Medicine at Mt","Gut Microbial β-Glucuronidase Inhibition via Catalytic Cycle Interception.","Microbial β-glucuronidases (GUSs) cause severe gut toxicities that limit theefficacy of cancer drugs and other therapeutics. Selective inhibitors ofbacterial GUS have been shown to alleviate these side effects. Using structuraland chemical biology, mass spectrometry, and cell-based assays, we establish thatpiperazine-containing GUS inhibitors intercept the glycosyl-enzyme catalyticintermediate of these retaining glycosyl hydrolases. We demonstrate thatpiperazine-based compounds are substrate-dependent GUS inhibitors that bind tothe GUS-GlcA catalytic intermediate as a piperazine-linked glucuronide (GlcA,glucuronic acid). We confirm the GUS-dependent formation of inhibitor-glucuronideconjugates by LC-MS and show that methylated piperazine analogs displaysignificantly reduced potencies. We further demonstrate that a range of approvedpiperazine- and piperidine-containing drugs from many classes, including thosefor the treatment of depression, infection, and cancer, function by the samemechanism, and we confirm through gene editing that these compounds selectivelyinhibit GUS in living bacterial cells. Together, these data reveal a uniquemechanism of GUS inhibition and show that a range of therapeutics may impact GUSactivities in the human gut."
" University of Southern California","General Relative Rate Models for the Analysis of Case-Cohort Designs.","A standard approach to analysis of case-cohort data involves fitting log-linearmodels. We describe how standard statistical software can be used to fit a broadclass of general relative rate models to case-cohort data and derive confidenceintervals. We focus on a case-cohort design in which a roster has been assembledand events ascertained, but additional information needs to be collected onexplanatory variables. The additional information is ascertained just forindividuals who experience the event of interest and for a sample of the cohortmembers enumerated at study entry. One appeal of such a case-cohort design isthat this sample of the cohort may be used to support analyses of severaloutcomes. The ability to fit general relative rate models to case cohort data mayallow an investigator to reduce model misspecification in exposure-responseanalyses, fit models in which some factors have effects that are additive andothers multiplicative, and facilitate estimation of relative excess risk due tointeraction. We address model fitting for simple random sampling designs as wellas stratified designs. Data on lung cancer among radon exposed men are used toillustrate these methods."

" King's College London","Filling GAPs in our knowledge: ARHGAPA and RACGAP act as oncogenes inbasal-like breast cancers.","Like RAS proteins, the aberrant function of RHO family small GTPases has beenimplicated in driving cancer development and growth. However, unlike the RASfamily, where gain-of-function missense mutations are found in ∼% of all humancancers, missense mutations are relatively rare in RHO proteins. Instead, alteredRHO activity in cancer more commonly arises through the aberrant functions of RHOGTPase regulators. In many cancer types, altered expression and/or mutation ofRHO-selective guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RHOGEFs) or GTPase-activatingproteins (RHOGAPs), which activate or inactivate RHO GTPases, respectively, isobserved. For example, deletion or loss of expression of the RHOA GAP DLC iswell-established to drive cancer growth. Recently, we identified high expressionof  RHOGAPs, ARHGAPA and RACGAP, in the basal-like breast cancer subtype.Unexpectedly, both of these RHOA GAPs exhibited properties of oncoproteins ratherthan tumor suppressors, in contrast to DLC. In this commentary, we summarize ourfindings and speculate that different RHOA GAPs can play distinct roles in cancerdepending on their spatial regulation and cancer type context. We also evaluateour results in light of recently-described cancer genome sequencing studies thathave identified loss-of-function mutations of RHOA in specific cancer types."

" CHRISTUS Santa Rosa Medical Center Hospital","Robot-assisted radical cystectomy versus open radical cystectomy in patients withbladder cancer (RAZOR): an open-label, randomised, phase , non-inferioritytrial.","BACKGROUND: Radical cystectomy is the surgical standard for invasive bladdercancer. Robot-assisted cystectomy has been proposed to provide similaroncological outcomes with lower morbidity. We aimed to compare progression-freesurvival in patients with bladder cancer treated with open cystectomy androbot-assisted cystectomy.METHODS: The RAZOR study is a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority, phase trial done in  medical centres in the USA. Eligible participants (aged ≥years) had biopsy-proven clinical stage T-T, N-N, M bladder cancer orrefractory carcinoma in situ. Individuals who had previously had open abdominalor pelvic surgery, or who had any pre-existing health conditions that wouldpreclude safe initiation or maintenance of pneumoperitoneum were excluded.Patients were centrally assigned (:) via a web-based system, with blockrandomisation by institution, stratified by type of urinary diversion, clinical Tstage, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, to receiverobot-assisted radical cystectomy or open radical cystectomy with extracorporealurinary diversion. Treatment allocation was only masked from pathologists. Theprimary endpoint was -year progression-free survival, with non-inferiorityestablished if the lower bound of the one-sided ·% CI for the treatmentdifference (robotic cystectomy minus open cystectomy) was greater than -percentage points. The primary analysis was done in the per-protocol population.Safety was assessed in the same population. This trial is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT.FINDINGS: Between July , , and Nov , ,  participants were randomlyassigned to treatment. The intended treatment was robotic cystectomy in patients and open cystectomy in  patients.  (%) of  patients in therobotic cystectomy group did not have surgery and nine (%) patients had adifferent surgery to that they were assigned.  (%) of  patients in theopen cystectomy group did not have surgery and one (%) patient had roboticcystectomy instead of open cystectomy. Thus,  patients ( in the roboticcystectomy group and  in the open cystectomy group) were included in theper-protocol analysis set. -year progression-free survival was ·% (% CI· to ·) in the robotic cystectomy group and ·% (% CI · to ·) inthe open cystectomy group (difference ·%, % CI -·% to ·%;pnon-inferiority=·), indicating non-inferiority of robotic cystectomy.Adverse events occurred in  (%) of  patients in the robotic cystectomygroup and  (%) of  patients in the open cystectomy group.

We assessed attitudes toward at-home HPV self-collectioncompared with clinic-based Pap testing in this higher-risk population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants were low-income women in North Carolinaoverdue for cervical cancer screening. Women self-collected samples at home,returned samples by mail for HPV testing, and completed phone questionnairesabout at-home HPV self-collection. Participants were referred to clinic-based Paptesting and invited to complete a second questionnaire about Pap testing. Across-sectional questionnaire compared attitudes, experiences, and preferencesfor self-collection versus Pap testing and assessed predictors of preference forHPV self-collection.RESULTS: Half (%) of  women reported a preference for HPV self-collection,% preferred Pap testing, and % reported no preference. More women reporteddifficulty finding time to do the Pap test (%) than the self-test (%, p =.) and being afraid of the self-test results (%) than the Pap test results(%, p = .). There were relatively fewer reports of physical discomfort andpain from self-collection than Pap testing (discomfort: % self; % Pap; pain:% self; % Pap, p = .).

" Harvard University","Replenishable drug depot to combat post-resection cancer recurrence.","Local drug presentation made possible by drug-eluting depots has demonstratedbenefits in a vast array of diseases, including in cancer, microbial infectionand in wound healing. However, locally-eluting depots are single-use systems thatcannot be refilled or reused after implantation at inaccessible sites, limitingtheir clinical utility. New strategies to noninvasively refill drug-elutingdepots could dramatically enhance their clinical use. In this report we present arefillable hydrogel depot system based on bioorthogonal click chemistry. Theclick-modified hydrogel depots capture prodrug refills from the blood andsubsequently release active drugs locally in a sustained manner. Capture of thesystemically-administered refills serves as an efficient and non-toxic method torepeatedly refill depots. Refillable depots in combination with prodrug refillsachieve sustained release at precancerous tumor sites to improve cancer therapywhile eliminating systemic side effects. The ability to target tissues withoutenhanced permeability could allow the use of refillable depots in cancer and manyother medical applications."

Developing a predictive algorithmis key to optimizing HER-targeting therapy.Experimental Design: We analyzed pretreatment tumors with mRNA-seq and DNA exome sequencing from CALGB , aneoadjuvant phase III trial of paclitaxel plus trastuzumab with or withoutlapatinib in stage II to III HER-positive breast cancer. We adopted an ElasticNet regularized regression approach that controls for covarying features withinhigh-dimensional data. First, we applied  known gene expression signatures todevelop an Elastic Net model to predict pCR, which we validated on  samplesfrom four independent trials. Next, we performed integrative analysesincorporating clinicopathologic information with somatic mutation status, DNAcopy number alterations (CNA), and gene signatures.Results: The Elastic Net modelusing only gene signatures predicted pCR in the validation sets (AUC = .).Integrative analyses showed that models containing gene signatures, clinicalfeatures, and DNA information were better pCR predictors than models containing asingle data type. Frequently selected variables from the multiplatform modelsincluded amplifications of chromosome p, TP mutation, HER-enriched subtype,and immune signatures. Variables predicting resistance included Luminal/ER+features.Conclusions: Models using RNA only, as well as integrated RNA and DNAmodels, can predict pCR with improved accuracy over clinical variables. SomaticDNA alterations (mutation, CNAs), tumor molecular subtype (HERE, Luminal), andthe microenvironment (immune cells) were independent predictors of response totrastuzumab and paclitaxel-based regimens.

The highest scores were for thePCC functions of Fostering Healing Relationships, Exchanging Information, andMaking Decisions. The lowest scores were for the functions of ManagingUncertainty and Enabling Self-Management, yet these were functions respondentsrated as most important. Respondents who thought about more than one healthprofessional (versus oncologist) reported better communication. PCC also variedby treatment type, mental and physical health status, age, race, and education.CONCLUSION: Most patients reported good communication overall, however patientsin poor physical health and mental health reported worse communication. Thequality of communication varied across the PCC functions.PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health professionals need to use a PCC approach thatbuilds trust, respects the patient, provides salient information that patientscan understand, provides emotional support, and facilitates the patient'sengagement in care."

" Cornell University","Genomic Instability Promoted by Overexpression of Mismatch Repair Factors inYeast: A Model for Understanding Cancer Progression.","Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins act in spellchecker roles to excisemisincorporation errors that occur during DNA replication. Curiously, large-scaleanalyses of a variety of cancers showed that increased expression of MMR proteinsoften correlated with tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and early recurrence. Tobetter understand these observations, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas and GeneExpression across Normal and Tumor tissue databases to analyze MMR proteinexpression in cancers. We found that the MMR genes MSH and MSH areoverexpressed more frequently than MSH, and that MSH and MSH are oftencooverexpressed as a result of copy number amplifications of these genes. Theseobservations encouraged us to test the effects of upregulating MMR protein levelsin baker's yeast, where we can sensitively monitor genome instability phenotypesassociated with cancer initiation and progression. Msh overexpression (two- tofourfold) almost completely disrupted mechanisms that prevent recombinationbetween divergent DNA sequences by interacting with the DNA polymeraseprocessivity clamp PCNA and by sequestering the Sgs helicase. Importantly,cooverexpression of Msh and Msh (∼eightfold) conferred, in a PCNAinteraction-dependent manner, several genome instability phenotypes includingincreased mutation rate, increased sensitivity to the DNA replication inhibitorHU and the DNA-damaging agents MMS and -nitroquinoline N-oxide, and elevatedloss-of-heterozygosity. Msh and Msh cooverexpression also altered the cellcycle distribution of exponentially growing cells, resulting in an increasedfraction of unbudded cells, consistent with a larger percentage of cells in G.These novel observations suggested that overexpression of MSH factors affectedthe integrity of the DNA replication fork, causing genome instability phenotypesthat could be important for promoting cancer progression."
" Acadia University ","Transition Metal Complexes and Photodynamic Therapy from a Tumor-CenteredApproach: Challenges, Opportunities, and Highlights from the Development ofTLD.","Transition metal complexes are of increasing interest as photosensitizers inphotodynamic therapy (PDT) and, more recently, for photochemotherapy (PCT). Inrecent years, Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes have emerged as promising systems forboth PDT and PCT. Their rich photochemical and photophysical properties derivefrom a variety of excited-state electronic configurations accessible with visibleand near-infrared light, and these properties can be exploited for both energy-and electron-transfer processes that can yield highly potent oxygen-dependentand/or oxygen-independent photobiological activity. Selected examples highlightthe use of rational design in coordination chemistry to control the lowest-energytriplet excited-state configurations for eliciting a particular type ofphotoreactivity for PDT and/or PCT effects.

"Northwestern University","Review of methodological challenges in comparing the effectiveness of neoadjuvantchemotherapy versus primary debulking surgery for advanced ovarian cancer in theUnited States.","Randomized trials outside the U.S. have found non-inferior survival forneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) foradvanced ovarian cancer (AOC). However, these trials reported lower overallsurvival and lower rates of optimal debulking than U.S. studies, leading toquestions about generalizability to U.S. practice, where aggressive debulking ismore common. Consequently, comparative effectiveness in the U.S. remainscontroversial. We reviewed U.S. comparative effectiveness studies of NACT versusPDS for AOC. Here we describe methodological challenges, compare results totrials outside the U.S., and make suggestions for future research. We identifiedU.S. studies published in  or later that evaluated the comparativeeffectiveness of NACT versus PDS on survival in AOC through a PubMed search. Twoindependent reviewers abstracted data from eligible articles. Nine of articles were eligible for review. Methodological challenges included unmeasuredconfounders, heterogeneous treatment effects, treatment variations over time, andinconsistent measurement of treatment and survival. Whereas some limitations wereunavoidable, several limitations noted across studies were avoidable, includingconditioning on mediating factors and immortal time introduced by measuringsurvival beginning from diagnosis. Without trials in the U.S., non-randomizedstudies are an important source of evidence for the ideal treatment for AOC.However, several methodological challenges exist when assessing the comparativeeffectiveness of NACT versus PDS in a non-randomized setting. Futureobservational studies must ensure that treatment is consistent throughout thestudy period and that treatment groups are comparable. Rapidly-evolving oncologydata networks may allow for identification of treatment intent and otherimportant confounders."

" University of Arkansas","Tumor-derived granulocyte colony-stimulating factor diminishes efficacy of breasttumor cell vaccines.","BACKGROUND: Although metastasis is ultimately responsible for about % of breastcancer mortality, the vast majority of breast-cancer-related deaths are due toprogressive recurrences from non-metastatic disease. Current adjuvant therapiesare unable to prevent progressive recurrences for a significant fraction ofpatients with breast cancer. Autologous tumor cell vaccines (ATCVs) are a safeand potentially useful strategy to prevent breast cancer recurrence, in apersonalized and patient-specific manner, following standard-of-care tumorresection. Given the high intra-patient and inter-patient heterogeneity in breastcancer, it is important to understand which factors influence the immunogenicityof breast tumor cells in order to maximize ATCV effectiveness.METHODS: The relative immunogenicity of two murine breast carcinomas, T andEMT, were compared in a prophylactic vaccination-tumor challenge model.Differences in cell surface expression of antigen-presentation-related andcostimulatory molecules were compared along with immunosuppressive cytokineproduction. CRISPR/Cas technology was used to modulate tumor-derived cytokinesecretion. The impacts of cytokine deletion on splenomegaly, myeloid-derivedsuppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation and ATCV immunogenicity were assessed.RESULTS: Mice vaccinated with an EMT vaccine exhibited significantly greaterprotective immunity than mice vaccinated with a T vaccine. Hybrid vaccinationstudies revealed that the T vaccination induced both local and systemic immuneimpairments. Although there were significant differences between EMT and T inthe expression of costimulatory molecules, major disparities in the secretion ofimmunosuppressive cytokines likely accounts for differences in immunogenicitybetween the cell lines. Ablation of one cytokine in particular,granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), reversed MDSC accumulation andsplenomegaly in the T model. Furthermore, G-CSF inhibition enhanced theimmunogenicity of a T-based vaccine to the extent that all vaccinated micedeveloped complete protective immunity.CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer cells that express high levels of G-CSF have thepotential to diminish or abrogate the efficacy of breast cancer ATCVs.Fortunately, this study demonstrates that genetic ablation of immunosuppressivecytokines, such as G-CSF, can enhance the immunogenicity of breast cancercell-based vaccines. Strategies that combine inhibition of immunosuppressivefactors with immune stimulatory co-formulations already under development mayhelp ATCVs reach their full potential."

" Duke University","Improving Access to Cancer Testing and Treatment in Kenya.","PURPOSE: In response to the increasing cancer burden in Kenya, this studyidentified barriers to patients seeking access to cancer testing and treatmentand to clinicians in delivering these services. Policy recommendations based onfindings are presented.METHODS: This qualitative study used semistructured key informant interviews.Purposive sampling was used to recruit  participants: seven oncology cliniciansand seven support and advocacy leaders for patients with cancer. Qualitativeanalysis was used to identify themes.RESULTS: Seven barriers to cancer testing and treatment were identified: highcost of testing and treatment, low level of knowledge about cancer amongpopulation and clinicians, poor health-seeking behaviors among population, longdistances to access diagnostic and treatment services, lack of decentralizeddiagnostic and treatment facilities, poor communication, and lack of bettercancer policy development and implementation.CONCLUSION: Kenyans seeking cancer services face significant barriers that resultin late presentation, misdiagnosis, interrupted treatment, stigma, and fear. Fourpolicy recommendations to improve access for patients with cancer are () improvehealth insurance for patients with cancer; () establish testing and treatmentfacilities in all counties; () acquire diagnosis and treatment equipment andtrain health personnel to screen, diagnose, and treat cancer; and () increasepublic health awareness and education about cancer to improve diagnoses andtreatment. Effective cancer testing and treatment options can be developed toaddress cancer in a resource-constrained environment like Kenya. An in-depth lookat effective interventions and policies being implemented in countries facingsimilar challenges would provide valuable lessons to Kenya's health sector andpolicymakers."
" Duke University Medical Center","Associations between expression levels of nucleotide excision repair proteins inlymphoblastoid cells and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","Squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) is one of the most commonmalignancies worldwide, and nucleotide excision repair (NER) is involved in SCCHNsusceptibility. In this analysis of  newly diagnosed SCCHN patients and cancer-free controls, we investigated whether expression levels of eight core NERproteins were associated with risk of SCCHN. We quantified NER protein expressionlevels in cultured peripheral lymphocytes using a reverse-phase proteinmicroarray. Compared with the controls, SCCHN patients had statisticallysignificantly lower expression levels of ERCC and XPA (P = . and .,respectively). After dividing the subjects by controls' median values ofexpression levels, we found a dose-dependent association between an increasedrisk of SCCHN and low expression levels of ERCC (adjusted OR, ., and % CI:.-.; Ptrend  = .) and XPA (adjusted OR, .; % CI, .-.;Ptrend  = .). We also identified a significant multiplicative interactionbetween smoking status and ERCC expression levels (P = .). Finally, afterintegrating demographic and clinical variables, we found that the addition ofERCC and XPA expression levels to the model significantly improved thesensitivity of the expanded model on SCCHN risk. In conclusion, reduced proteinexpression levels of ERCC and XPA were associated with an increased risk ofSCCHN. However, these results need to be confirmed in additional large studies."

Compared with the controls, SCCHN patients had statisticallysignificantly lower expression levels of ERCC and XPA (P = . and .,respectively). After dividing the subjects by controls' median values ofexpression levels, we found a dose-dependent association between an increasedrisk of SCCHN and low expression levels of ERCC (adjusted OR, ., and % CI:.-.; Ptrend  = .) and XPA (adjusted OR, .; % CI, .-.;Ptrend  = .). We also identified a significant multiplicative interactionbetween smoking status and ERCC expression levels (P = .). Finally, afterintegrating demographic and clinical variables, we found that the addition ofERCC and XPA expression levels to the model significantly improved thesensitivity of the expanded model on SCCHN risk. In conclusion, reduced proteinexpression levels of ERCC and XPA were associated with an increased risk ofSCCHN. However, these results need to be confirmed in additional large studies."

We used nonparametric multiple imputation toaccount for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorizedviral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <, -,-, and > copies/mL.

We evaluated the risk of breast cancer in relation to exposure totoxic metallic substances in air, individually and combined, in a U.S. widecohort.METHODS: We recruited Sister Study participants (n=,), breast cancer-freewomen who had a sister with breast cancer, from -. The  EnvironmentalProtection Agency National Air Toxic Assessment's census-tract estimates of metalconcentrations in air (antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead,manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium) were matched to participants'enrollment residence. We used Cox regression to estimate the association betweenquintiles of individual metals and breast cancer incidence and weighted quantilesum regression to model the association between the metal mixture and breastcancer.RESULTS: , breast cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up (mean=.years). In individual chemical analyses comparing the highest to lowestquintiles, postmenopausal breast cancer risk was elevated for mercury (hazardratio [HR]=., % confidence interval [CI]: .-.), cadmium (HR=., %CI:.-.), and lead (HR=., %CI: .-.). The weighted quantile sum indexwas associated with postmenopausal breast cancer (odds ratio (OR)=., %CI:.-.). Consistent with the individual chemical analysis, the most highlyweighted chemicals for predicting postmenopausal breast cancer risk were lead,cadmium, and mercury. Results were attenuated for overall breast cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of some airborne metals, specifically mercury,cadmium, and lead, were associated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breastcancer."

Next, we conducted an MR analysis of lung (  cases,  controls) and head and neck cancer ( cases,  controls) using eightgenetic instruments for TL. Lastly, the p. instrument and distinct p.lung cancer risk loci were evaluated using two-sample mediation analysis, toquantify their direct and indirect, telomere-mediated, effects.Results: The multi-allelic p. instrument explained .-.% of TLvariation in our data (p = . × -). The MR analysis estimated that a base-pair increase in TL increases risk of lung cancer [odds ratio (OR) = .,% confidence interval (CI): .-.] and lung adenocarcinoma (OR = ., %CI: .-.), but not squamous lung carcinoma (OR = ., % CI: .-.) orhead and neck cancers (OR = ., % CI: .-.). Mediation analysis of thep. instrument indicated an absence of direct effects on lung cancer risk(OR = ., % CI: .-.). Analysis of distinct p. susceptibilityvariants estimated that TL mediates up to % of the observed associations withlung cancer risk.Conclusions: Our findings support a causal role for long telomeres in lung canceraetiology, particularly for adenocarcinoma, and demonstrate that telomeremaintenance partially mediates the lung cancer susceptibility conferred byp. loci."

A preponderance of this research focuses on the Latin American case andon cancer-specific screening. This study seeks to expand knowledge of suchpreventative-health screening differences by analyzing screening rates for bloodsugar, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol among nine groups overall and (forimmigrants) at various stages of US residency. Using nationally representativedata from the National Health Interview Survey, we find that immigrants fromeight geographic regions receive preventative care at lower rates than US-bornWhites and that preventative screening is generally higher after  years thanduring the first  years of residency in the United States. Importantly, our dataalso show that screening patterns and trends vary based on region of origin andoutcome. These findings improve our understanding of immigrant health andhealth care use in the United States."

Conclusion Six cycles of ddGC is an active, well-toleratedneoadjuvant regimen for the treatment of patients with MIBC. The presence of aputative deleterious DDR gene alteration in pretreatment tumor tissue stronglypredicted for chemosensitivity, durable response, and superior long-termsurvival."
" Fudan University","Development of [F]AlF-NOTA-NT as PET Agents of Neurotensin Receptor- PositivePancreatic Cancer.","Several studies have suggested that neurotensin receptors (NTRs) and neurotensin(NT) greatly affect the growth and survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC). Developing NTR-targeted PET probes could therefore be important for themanagement of a pancreatic cancer patient by providing key information on the NTRexpression profile noninvasively. Despite the initial success on the synthesis ofF-labeled NT PET probes, the labeling procedure generally requires lengthysteps including azeotropic drying of F. Using a straightforward chelationmethod, here we report the simple preparation of aluminum-F-NOTA-NT startingfrom aqueous F. The cell binding test demonstrated that [F]AlF-NOTA-NTmaintained high receptor-binding affinity to NTR. This probe was then furtherevaluated in NTR positive pancreatic tumor models (AsPC- and PANC-). After theadministration of [F]AlF-NOTA-NT, small animal PET studies showed a highcontrast between tumor and background in both models at  and  h time points. Ablocking experiment was performed to demonstrate the receptor specificity: thetumor uptake in AsPC without and with blocking agent was . ± . and . ±.%ID/g, respectively, at  h post injection. In summary, a NTR specific PETagent, [F]AlF-NOTA-NT, was prepared through the simple chelation method. ThisNTR-targeted PET probe may not only be used to detect NTR positive pancreatictumors (diagnosis), but also it may be fully integrated to NTR target therapyleading to personalized medicine (theranostic)."

Data fromsystematic reviews of the current state of published research in patient-reportedoutcomes in cancer RCTs indicated a lack of clear reporting of researchhypothesis and analytic strategies, and inconsistency in definitions of terms,including ""missing data,""""health-related quality of life,"" and ""patient-reportedoutcome."" Based on the meeting proceedings, the Consortium will focus on threekey priorities in the coming year: developing a taxonomy of research objectives,identifying appropriate statistical methods to analyze patient-reported outcomedata, and determining best practices to evaluate and deal with missing data.Conclusion The quality of the Consortium guidelines and recommendations areinformed and enhanced by the broad Consortium membership which includesregulators, patients, clinicians, and academics."

" Vanderbilt University","Parental psychological distress and cancer stage: a comparison of adults withmetastatic and non-metastatic cancer.","PURPOSE: Parents with cancer have unique and often under-recognized psychologicaldistress about the impact of their illness on their children. Relatively littleis known about how parenting concerns may differ among patients by cancer stage.METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis of  adults with cancer who hadchildren <  years old from two geographically distinct areas. We used ananalysis of covariance to estimate the mean differences in PCQ, depressionsymptom severity and anxiety symptom severity (Hospital Anxiety and DepressionScale, HADS) scores between participants with metastatic and non-metastaticdisease, and Pearson's correlation coefficients to assess associations betweenHADS and PCQ scores by cancer stage.RESULTS: Seventy-two percent of participants (n = ) had metastatic solid tumorcancer. In adjusted analyses, mean PCQ scores did not significantly differbetween parents with metastatic and non-metastatic disease (. vs. .,p = .). Differences in mean PCQ scores were driven by a single questionconcerning the impact of death on children (. vs. ., p = .). Mean HADSscores did not significantly differ between groups, although PCQ scores explaineda greater amount of variance in HADS scores for the metastatic group as comparedto the non-metastatic group.CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of concerns about death, intensity of parentingconcerns, as measured by the PCQ, was similar between parents with metastatic andnon-metastatic cancer. However, parenting concerns may be more strongly linked tooverall psychological distress in patients with metastatic disease.

"RTI International","Patient Preferences and Willingness to Pay for Cervical Cancer Prevention inZambia: Protocol for a Multi-Cohort Discrete Choice Experiment.","BACKGROUND: Although most countries in southern Africa have cervical cancerscreening programs, these programs generally fail to reach a significant majorityof women because they are often implemented as pilot or research projects, andthis limits their scope and ability to scale up screening. Some countries haveplanned larger-scale programs, but these have either never been implemented orhave not been successfully scaled up. Most of the global burden of cervicalcancer is experienced in countries with limited resources, and mortality fromcervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths among women inSub-Saharan Africa.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to learn about preferences for cervicalcancer screening in Zambia, to identify barriers and facilitators for screeninguptake, and to evaluate willingness to pay for screening services to support thescaling up of cervical cancer screening programs.METHODS: We will conduct a discrete choice experiment by interviewing women andmen and asking them to choose among constructed scenarios with varyingcombinations of attributes relevant to cervical cancer screening. To inform thediscrete choice experiment, we will conduct focus groups and interviews aboutgeneral knowledge and attitudes about cervical screening, perception about theavailability of screening, stigma associated with cancer and HIV, and payment forhealth care services. For the discrete choice experiment, we will have a maximumdesign of  choice sets divided into  sets of  tasks each with a sample sizeof - respondents. We will use a hierarchical Bayesian estimation procedureto assess attributes at the following two levels: group and individual levels.RESULTS: The model will generate preferences for attributes to assess the mostimportant features and allow for the assessment of differences among cohorts. Wewill conduct policy simulations reflecting potential changes in the attributes ofthe screening facilities and calculate the projected changes in preference forchoosing to undergo cervical cancer screening. The findings from the discretechoice experiment will be supplemented with interviews, focus groups, and patientsurveys to ensure a comprehensive and context-based interpretation of theresults.CONCLUSIONS: Because willingness to pay for cervical cancer screening has notbeen previously assessed, this will be a unique and important contribution to theliterature. This study will take into account the high HIV prevalence inSub-Saharan Africa and prevailing gender attitudes to identify an optimal packageof interventions to reduce cervical cancer incidence. This simulation of women'sdecisions (and men's support) to undergo screening will lay the foundation forunderstanding the stated preferences and willingness to pay to help design futurescreening programs.REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER: RR-./."

" Penn State College of Medicine","Support for Pharmacist-Provided HPV Vaccination: National Surveys of U.S.Physicians and Parents.","Background: State laws about pharmacists providing human papillomavirus (HPV)vaccines vary considerably, limiting many pharmacists' ability to provide thisimportant cancer prevention service. We characterized physician and parentsupport for pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination for adolescents who are past duefor vaccination.Methods: In  to , we conducted two national U.S. surveysof  primary care physicians (PCPs) and , parents of adolescents.Respondents indicated the extent to which they supported pharmacist-provided HPVvaccination for - to -year-olds who are past due. Respondents could endorsethe provision unconditionally, or only if certain conditions were met, such aspharmacists receiving proper vaccination training. We used multivariable logisticregression to assess correlates of support.Results: Most physicians (%) andparents (%) endorsed pharmacist-provided HPV vaccination if pharmacists hadreceived proper vaccination training, reported vaccine doses to adolescents' PCP,and referred adolescents to PCPs for other health services. Family medicinephysicians were more likely than pediatricians to support trained pharmacistsproviding HPV vaccination [OR = .; % confidence interval (CI) .-.].Support was also higher among physicians who practiced in Western states (OR =.; % CI, .-.). Parents' odds of endorsing trained pharmacistsprovision of HPV vaccine increased with higher overall satisfaction with theirpharmacy's services (OR = .; % CI, .-.), belief in pharmacists'competence in vaccination practices (OR = .; % CI, .-.), and overallvaccine confidence (OR = .; % CI, .-.).Conclusions: To increasesupport for HPV vaccination services, pharmacists should raise awareness abouttheir immunization training and standardize vaccination protocols that ensurecoordination with primary care.Impact: Stakeholders' feedback and buy-in isimportant to help guide expansion of HPV vaccination in pharmacies.

Cumulative -year interval cancer risk washighest for women with estrogen receptor- and progesterone receptor-negativeprimary breast cancer (.%; % CI, .% to .%), interval cancer presentationat primary diagnosis (.%; % CI, .% to .%), and breast conservationwithout radiation (.%; % CI, .% to .%). Conclusion Risk of intervalinvasive second breast cancer varies across women and is influenced bycharacteristics that can be measured at initial diagnosis, treatment, andimaging. Risk prediction models that evaluate the risk of cancers not detected bysurveillance mammography should be developed to inform discussions of tailoredsurveillance."
" Kindai University","Protease-activated receptor  activation enhances doxorubicin-inducedcardiotoxicity.","OBJECTIVE: The anti-cancer anthracycline drug Doxorubicin (Dox) causescardiotoxicity. We investigated the role of protease-activated receptor  (PAR-)in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.METHODS AND RESULTS: In vitro experiments revealed that PAR- enhancedDox-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species and cell death ofcardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. The contribution of PAR- toDox-induced cardiotoxicity was investigated by subjecting PAR--/- mice andPAR-+/+ mice to acute and chronic exposure to Dox. Heart function was measuredby echocardiography. PAR--/- mice exhibited significant less cardiac injury anddysfunction compared to PAR-+/+ mice after acute and chronic Dox administration.PAR--/- mice had reduced levels of nitrotyrosine, apoptosis and inflammation intheir heart compared to PAR-+/+ mice. Furthermore, inhibition of PAR- inwild-type mice with vorapaxar significantly reduced the acute Dox-inducedcardiotoxicity.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that activation of PAR- contributes toDox-induced cardiotoxicity. Inhibition of PAR- may be a new approach to reduceDox-induced cardiotoxicity in cancer patients."
" University of Colorado School of Medicine ","Recognition of cancer mutations in histone HK by epigenetic writers andreaders.","Histone posttranslational modifications control the organization and function ofchromatin. In particular, methylation of lysine  in histone H (HKme) hasbeen shown to mediate gene transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, andpre-mRNA splicing. Notably, mutations at or near this residue have been causallylinked to the development of several human cancers. These observations havehelped to illuminate the role of histones themselves in disease and to clarifythe mechanisms by which they acquire oncogenic properties. This perspectivefocuses on recent advances in discovery and characterization of histone Hmutations that impact HK methylation. We also highlight findings that thecommon cancer-related substitution of HK to methionine (HKM) disturbsfunctions of not only HKme-writing enzymes but also HKme-specific readers.The latter case suggests that the oncogenic effects could also be linked to theinability of readers to engage HKM."

" Public Health Sciences Division Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center","Joint skeleton estimation of multiple directed acyclic graphs for heterogeneouspopulation.","The directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a powerful tool to model the interactions ofhigh-dimensional variables. While estimating edge directions in a DAG oftenrequires interventional data, one can estimate the skeleton of a DAG (i.e., anundirected graph formed by removing the direction of each edge in a DAG) usingobservational data. In real data analyses, the samples of the high-dimensionalvariables may be collected from a mixture of multiple populations. Eachpopulation has its own DAG while the DAGs across populations may have significantoverlap. In this article, we propose a two-step approach to jointly estimate theDAG skeletons of multiple populations while the population origin of each samplemay or may not be labeled. In particular, our method allows a probabilistic softlabel for each sample, which can be easily computed and often leads to moreaccurate skeleton estimation than hard labels. Compared with separate estimationof skeletons for each population, our method is more accurate and robust tolabeling errors. We study the estimation consistency for our method, anddemonstrate its performance using simulation studies in different settings.Finally, we apply our method to analyze gene expression data from breast cancerpatients of multiple cancer subtypes."

This trial assessed the effectof an alternate  weeks on,  week off (/) schedule of sunitinib on toxicityand efficacy in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cellcarcinoma. Methods Patients started with oral administration of  mg sunitinibon a / schedule and underwent schedule and dose alterations if toxicitydeveloped. The primary end point was < % grade ≥  fatigue, diarrhea, or HFS.With  patients, the upper bound of the CI would fall below the published /schedule grade ≥  toxicity rate of % to %. Results Fifty-nine patients weretreated between August  and March . Seventy-seven percent wereintermediate or poor risk per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center criteria.With a median follow-up of  months, % of patients experienced grade fatigue, HFS, or diarrhea; % required a dose reduction, and % discontinuedbecause of toxicity. The overall response rate was %, median progression-freesurvival was . months, and median overall survival was not reached. At weeks, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scores dropped between %and % from baseline, with less reduction in patients who continued treatmentlonger.

CellularAP- proteins with alanine-to-serine [AP-(A/S)] substitutions homologous toZEBRA(S) assume some functions of EBV ZEBRA. These AP-(A/S) mutants bindmethylated EBV DNA and activate expression of some EBV genes. Here, we compareexpression of  viral genes induced by ZEBRA versus expression induced byAP-(A/S) proteins. AP-(A/S) activated  genes to high levels and  genes tointermediate levels; activation of  genes by AP-(A/S) was severely impaired.We show that AP-(A/S) proteins are defective at stimulating viral lytic DNAreplication. The impairment of expression of many late genes compared to that ofZEBRA is likely due to the inability of AP-(A/S) proteins to promote viral DNAreplication. However, even in the absence of detectable viral DNA replication,AP-(A/S) proteins stimulated expression of a subgroup of late genes that encodeviral structural proteins and immune modulators. In response to ZEBRA, expressionof this subgroup of late genes was inhibited by phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), whichis a potent viral replication inhibitor. However, when the lytic cycle wasactivated by AP-(A/S), PAA did not reduce expression of this subgroup of lategenes. We also provide genetic evidence, using the BMRF knockout bacmid, thatthese genes are true late genes in response to ZEBRA. AP-(A/S) binds to thepromoter region of at least one of these late genes, BDLF, encoding an immunemodulator.IMPORTANCE Mutant c-Jun and c-Fos proteins selectively activateexpression of EBV lytic genes, including a subgroup of viral late genes, in theabsence of viral DNA replication. These findings indicate that newly synthesizedviral DNA is not invariably required for viral late gene expression. While viralDNA replication may be obligatory for late gene expression driven by viraltranscription factors, it does not limit the ability of cellular transcriptionfactors to activate expression of some viral late genes. Our results show thatexpression of all late genes may not be strictly dependent on viral lytic DNAreplication. The c-Fos AS mutation has been identified in a human cancer.c-Fos AS in combination with wild-type c-Jun activates the EBV lytic cycle.Our data provide proof of principle that mutant cellular transcription factorscould cause aberrant regulation of viral lytic cycle gene expression and playimportant roles in EBV-associated diseases."

The primarymiRNA sequence was identified for  miRNA genes expressed in Encyclopedia ofDNA Elements (ENCODE) Tier  cell types and human pancreatic islets. Associationanalysis was conducted using logistic regression for BC status overall and bytumor subtype.RESULTS: A novel BC signal was localized to an .-kb region of q. by fourSNPs (rs, rs, rs, and rs) and remainedstatistically significant after multiple test correction (odds ratio (OR) = .,% confidence interval (CI) = .-.; p = . × -; false discovery rate(FDR) = .). These SNPs reside in a genomic location that includes both thepredicted primary transcript of the noncoding miRNA gene MIR and the firstintron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor -associated protein (BAIAP). Furthermore, miRNA-associated SNPs on chromosomes p., q, andp. were the strongest signals for hormone receptor, luminal versusbasal-like, and HER enrichment status, respectively. A second phase ofgenotyping ( BC cases,  controls) that included two SNPs in the .-kbregion was used for validation and meta-analysis. While neither rs norrs was validated, when meta-analyzed with the original dataset theirassociation with BC remained directionally consistent (OR = ., % CI =.-. (p = . × -) and OR = ., % CI = .-. (p = . × -),respectively).CONCLUSION: Germline genetic variation indicates that MIR may play animportant role in BC development and heterogeneity among AA women. Furtherinvestigation to determine the potential functional effects of these SNPs iswarranted. This study contributes to our understanding of BC risk in AA women andhighlights the complexity in evaluating variation in gene-dense regions of thehuman genome."

These SNPs reside in a genomic location that includes both thepredicted primary transcript of the noncoding miRNA gene MIR and the firstintron of the gene for brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor -associated protein (BAIAP). Furthermore, miRNA-associated SNPs on chromosomes p., q, andp. were the strongest signals for hormone receptor, luminal versusbasal-like, and HER enrichment status, respectively. A second phase ofgenotyping ( BC cases,  controls) that included two SNPs in the .-kbregion was used for validation and meta-analysis. While neither rs norrs was validated, when meta-analyzed with the original dataset theirassociation with BC remained directionally consistent (OR = ., % CI =.-. (p = . × -) and OR = ., % CI = .-. (p = . × -),respectively).CONCLUSION: Germline genetic variation indicates that MIR may play animportant role in BC development and heterogeneity among AA women. Furtherinvestigation to determine the potential functional effects of these SNPs iswarranted. This study contributes to our understanding of BC risk in AA women andhighlights the complexity in evaluating variation in gene-dense regions of thehuman genome."

The patient was originally started on a four-drugantituberculous regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and PZA. Aftergenotypic analysis identified the organism as M. bovis (BCG), the regimen waschanged to isoniazid and rifampin for  months. The patient responded well tothis treatment. This case is unique as the patient received only intravesicalmitomycin and did not receive BCG, implying the possibility of transmission fromcontaminated equipment."

Due to previous reports of a high rate of adverseevent when used long-term, concerns have been raised with regard to the use ofself-expandable metal stents in patients with a longer survival.AIM: assess the role of esophageal self-expandable metal stents in patients withadvanced esophageal cancer that have survived longer than six months.METHODS: retrospective study of patients with advanced esophageal cancer with aself-expandable metal stent and a stent placement time greater than six months.RESULTS: forty-two patients were followed up for  days. There was a clinicalimprovement in all patients. However, % of patients experienced an adverseevent. The median stent patency was  days. Endoscopic management was attemptedin all self-expandable metal related adverse events, with a clinical success rateof %. However, the previously treated adverse event recurred in sevenpatients. Multivariate analysis showed that strictures that were traversable withan ultrathin gastroscope were associated with a higher risk of adverse events (p= .).CONCLUSIONS: long-term esophageal stenting in patients with advanced esophagealcancer is associated with a high prevalence of adverse events without an impacton mortality; most cases can be managed endoscopically."

The inverse associationwith premenopausal breast cancer risk is poorly characterized but might beimportant in the understanding of breast cancer causation.Objective: To investigate the association of BMI with premenopausal breast cancerrisk, in particular by age at BMI, attained age, risk factors for breast cancer,and tumor characteristics.Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter analysis used pooledindividual-level data from   premenopausal women from  prospectivecohorts to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of premenopausal breast cancer inassociation with BMI from ages  through  years using Cox proportional hazardsregression analysis.

One major hurdle that exists is inadequatedrug delivery due to the desmoplastic stroma and poor vascularization that ischaracteristic of pancreatic cancer. The local iontophoretic delivery ofchemotherapies provides a novel way of improving treatment. With the growingpractice of highly toxic combination therapies in the treatment of pancreaticcancer, the use of iontophoresis for local delivery can potentiate theanti-cancer effects of these therapies while sparing unwanted toxicity. Theobjective of this study was to investigate the impact of formulation on theelectro-transport of the FOLFIRINOX regimen for the development of a newtreatment for pancreatic cancer.METHODS: Three formulations of the FOLFIRINOX regimen (-fluorouracil,leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) were generated at a fixed pH of . andwere referred to as formulation A (single drug solution with all four drugscombined), formulation B (two drug solutions with two drugs per solution), andformulation C (four individual drug solutions). Anodic iontophoresis of the threedifferent formulations was evaluated in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts ofpancreatic cancer.RESULTS: Iontophoretic transport of the FOLFIRINOX drugs was characterizedaccording to organ exposure after a single device treatment in vivo. We reportthat the co-iontophoresis of two drug solutions, leucovorin + oxaliplatin and-fluorouracil + irinotecan, resulted in the highest levels of cytotoxic drugs inthe tumor compared to drugs delivered individually or combined into one solution.There was no significant difference in plasma, pancreas, kidney, and liverexposure to the cytotoxic drugs delivered by the three different formulations.

Immunotherapy foradvanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has resulted in a new paradigm oftreatment options resulting in improved survival and response rates and has aless severe yet unique toxicity profile when compared to chemotherapy. PD-inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, and PD-L inhibitor, atezolizumab, arecurrently approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.This article provides a detailed review of these newer agents, their mechanism ofaction, side-effect profile, therapeutic indications and current evidencesupporting their use in the management of NSCLC."
" University of Wisconsin School of Medicine","MERTK mediates intrinsic and adaptive resistance to AXL-targeting agents.","The TAM (TYRO-, AXL, MERTK) family receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play animportant role in promoting growth, survival, and metastatic spread of severaltumor types. AXL and MERTK are overexpressed in head and neck squamous cellcarcinoma (HNSCC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and non-small cell lungcancer (NSCLC), malignancies that are highly metastatic and lethal. AXL is themost well-characterized TAM receptor and mediates resistance to both conventionaland targeted cancer therapies. Since AXL is highly expressed in aggressive tumortypes, cancer patients are currently being enrolled in clinical trials testingAXL inhibitors. In the current study, we analyzed the effects of AXL inhibitionusing a small molecule AXL inhibitor, monoclonal antibody therapy, and siRNA inHNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models. Anti-AXL targeting strategies hadlimited efficacy across these different models which our data suggests could beattributed to upregulation of MERTK. MERTK expression was increased in cell linesand patient-derived xenografts treated with AXL inhibitors and inhibition ofMERTK sensitized HNSCC, TNBC, and NSCLC preclinical models to AXL inhibition.Dual targeting of AXL and MERTK led to a more potent blockade of downstreamsignaling, synergistic inhibition of tumor cell expansion in culture, and reducedtumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of MERTK in AXLinhibitor-sensitive models resulted in resistance to AXL-targeting strategies.These observations suggest that therapeutic strategies co-targeting both AXL andMERTK could be highly beneficial in a variety of tumor types where both receptorsare expressed, leading to improved survival for patients with lethalmalignancies."

National Medicare costs were estimated usingper-person costs, stage-adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates by age from SEER through , and  Census population estimates by age.Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated costs to the Medicare program overall, andin each (mutually exclusive) category related to diagnosis and workup, treatment,follow-up, and morbidity management.Results: This nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study included  men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from the SEER-Medicare database(all participants were  years or older;   [.%] were  years or older).The median per-patient cost within  years after prostate cancer diagnosis was$  (interquartile range [IQR], $-$ ). The majority of this cost wasattributable to treatment costs (median, $ ; IQR, $-$ ). Patientswith a Gleason score of  or lower who pursued initial conservative management(no treatment within  months of diagnosis) had a -year median total cost of$ per patient. The estimated total -year cost to the Medicare programassociated with the annual detection of prostate cancer in men  years or olderis approximately $. billion.

We analyzed the microbiomecomposition of samples from  CRC patients and  healthy individuals by SrRNA amplicon sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis of samples revealeddefined cancer versus healthy clusters. Our findings showed that cancer sampleshad higher proportions of Firmicutes (T = .%; N = .%; p = .),specifically of Clostridia (T = .%; N = .%; p = .), and Fusobacteria(T = .%; N = .%; p = .), especially of Fusobacteriia (T = .%; N = .%;p = .), while Bacteroidetes were enriched in healthy samples (T = .%;N = .%; p = .), particularly the class Bacteroidia (T = .%; N = .%;p = .). Porphyromonas, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Selenomonas, andFusobacterium were significantly overrepresented in diseased patients, similarlyto other studies. Predicted functional information showed that bacterial motilityproteins, flagellar assembly, and fatty acid biosynthesis metabolism weresignificantly overrepresented in cancer patients, while amino acid metabolism andglycan biosynthesis were overrepresented in controls. This suggests thatinvolvement of these functional metagenomes is similar and relevant in thecarcinogenesis process, independent of the origin of the samples. Results fromthis study allowed identification of bacterial taxa relevant to the Moroccanpopulation and encourages larger studies to facilitate population-directedtherapeutic approaches."

" University of the Witwatersrand","Costs and cost-effectiveness of LEEP versus cryotherapy for treating cervicaldysplasia among HIV-positive women in Johannesburg, South Africa.","BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer incidence is significant in countries, such as SouthAfrica, with high burdens of both HIV and human papillomavirus (HPV). Cervicalcancer is largely preventable if dysplasia is diagnosed and treated early, butthere is debate regarding the best approaches for screening and treatment,especially for low-resource settings. Currently South Africa provides Pap smearsfollowed by colposcopic biopsy and LEEP if needed in its public healthfacilities. We estimated the costs and cost-effectiveness of two approaches fortreating cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade  or higher (CIN+) amongHIV-infected women, most of whom were taking antiretroviral treatment, at apublic HIV treatment facility in Johannesburg, South Africa.METHODS: Method effectiveness was derived from an intention-to-treat analysis ofdata gathered in a clinical trial completed previously at the study facility. Inthe trial, women who were diagnosed with CIN+ and eligible for cryotherapy wererandomized to cryotherapy or LEEP. If women were CIN+ at six months asdetermined via Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy, all women-regardless of theiroriginal treatment assignment-received LEEP. ""Cure"" was then defined as theabsence of disease at  months based on Pap smear and colposcopic biopsy. Healthservice costs were estimated using micro-costing between June  and April. Capital costs were annualized using a discount rate of %. Two differentservice volume scenarios were considered, and results from an as-treated analysiswere considered in sensitivity analysis.RESULTS: In total,  women with CIN+ were enrolled ( had LEEP;  hadcryotherapy). At  months, cumulative loss to follow-up was .% (/) forthe LEEP group and .% (/) for cryotherapy. Based on the unadjustedintention-to-treat analysis conducted for this economic evaluation, there was nosignificant difference in efficacy. At  months, .% (% CI .-.) ofwomen with CIN+ at baseline and randomized to cryotherapy were free of CIN+disease. In contrast, .% (% CI .-.) of women assigned to LEEP werefree from disease.

Agreement between clinician (CTCAEv.) andpatient (PRO-CTCAE, EORTC QLQ-C) report of toxicities were assessed atbaseline, during treatment, and post-treatment. The association of clinician- andpatient-reported symptoms with poor tolerance to therapy (defined ashospitalization, >-day treatment delay, change in treatment regimen, or death)was assessed.RESULTS: Among  patients, median age was , % had head and neck cancer, and% received concurrent chemotherapy with RT. In comparing CTCAE vs PRO-CTCAE,there was good agreement at baseline except for fatigue, anorexia, and pain,where clinicians under-reported the severity. The discrepancy increased duringtreatment with clinicians reporting lower severity in ≥% of matched pairs for/ symptoms assessed. At follow-up, clinicians under-reported severity in ≥%of pairs for / symptoms. CTCAE vs EORTC QLQ-C mirrored these findings.Patient-reported symptoms of nausea and dysphagia at  weeks andclinician-observed symptoms of nausea and dysphagia at  weeks were associatedwith poor tolerance to therapy.CONCLUSION: Clinicians under-report toxicities during and after curative RT inolder patients with head and neck or lung cancer.

Theswallowing function was objectively scored for penetration, aspiration, andpharyngeal residue. Forty patients received de-intensified chemoradiation therapy( Gy image guided radiation therapy with weekly cisplatin  mg/m) and patients received standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy ( Gy image guidedradiation therapy with chemotherapy of the medical oncologist's choosing).Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect differences betweenthe cohorts with regard to laryngeal penetration, aspiration, and pharyngealresidue. A multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the overalleffect of treatment on the swallowing function. Patient-reported swallowingoutcomes in de-intensified cohort were assessed with the European Organisationfor Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Module for Head and NeckCancer and the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common TerminologyCriteria for Adverse Events questionnaires.Results: Patients treated with de-intensified chemoradiation therapy wereassociated with a suggestion of lower risk of developing overall swallowingdysfunction (odds ratio [OR], .; P = .), laryngeal penetration (OR, .;P = .), and pharyngeal residue (OR, .; P = .).

" Levine Cancer Institute","Personalizing aromatase inhibitor therapy in patients with breast cancer.","BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are the mainstay of therapy for patients withhormone receptor-positive breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings.Their use in clinical practice has been challenged by significantinter-individual variability in response and tolerability. Hence, the purpose ofthis paper is to provide a succinct review of the literature on the geneticfactors contributing to this variability.DESIGN: A systematic search in PUBMED was conducted to identify studies thatinvestigated the association between germline polymorphisms and disposition,clinical response and toxicities of aromatase inhibitors, as well as thoseevaluating the implications of mutations in ESR on clinical response.RESULTS: Polymorphisms in genes coding for phase I and phase II enzymes(pharmacokinetic genes) significantly modulated exposure to aromatase inhibitors;however, there is a paucity of data linking interindividual variability in drugexposure to clinical response. Furthermore, pharmacogenetic studies interrogatingrelationship between polymorphisms in CYPA (the target site of aromataseinhibitors, i.e. a pharmacodynamic gene) and response yielded conflictingresults. Acquired mutations in ESR receptors have been identified as theunderlying mechanism of resistance to aromatase inhibitors, and likely predictdrug response. Although some pharmacogenetic studies have implicatedpolymorphisms in CYPA and ESR with drug-related side effects, the putativerole of these genes in predicting toxicity warrants further validation.CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic genesappear to influence aromatase inhibitor disposition, response and/or toxicity;however, prospective interventional studies are needed to understand theapplication of genomics to personalize aromatase inhibitor therapy in breastcancer patients."

" Murdock Research Institute","Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomic Differences between Hormone-Responsive andTriple-Negative Breast Cancer Cell Lines.","Purpose: To conduct an exploratory study to identify mechanisms thatdifferentiate Luminal A (BT and MCF-) and triple-negative (MDA-MB- andMDA-MB-) breast cancer (BCa) cell lines to potentially provide noveltherapeutic targets based on differences in energy utilization.Methods: Cells were cultured in media containing either [U-C]-glucose or[U-C]-glutamine for  hours. Conditioned media and cellular extracts wereanalyzed by H and C NMR spectroscopy.Results: MCF- cells consumed the most glucose, producing the most lactate,demonstrating the greatest Warburg effect-associated energy utilization. BTcells had the highest tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) activity. The majority ofenergy utilization patterns in MCF- cells were more similar to MDA-MB- cells,while the patterns for BT cells were more similar to MDA-MB- cells.Compared to the Luminal A cell lines, TNBC cell lines consumed more glutamine andless glucose. BT and MDA-MB- cells produced high amounts of C-glycinefrom media [U-C]-glucose which was integrated into glutathione, indicating denovo synthesis.Conclusions: Stable isotopic resolved metabolomics using C substrates providedmechanistic information about energy utilization that was difficult to interpretusing H data alone. Overall, cell lines that have different hormone receptorstatus have different energy utilization requirements, even if they areclassified by the same clinical BCa subtype; and these differences offer cluesabout optimizing treatment strategies."

"Boston University","Implementing a Program of Talimogene laherparepvec.","BACKGROUND: Oncolytic viruses are genetically engineered or naturally occurringviruses that selectively replicate in cancer cells without harming normal cells.Talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic®), the first oncolytic viral therapy approvedfor treatment of cancer, was approved for treatment of locally advanced melanomain October .PURPOSE: As a biologic product, use of T. laherparepvec in the clinical settingrequires pretreatment planning and a unique systematic approach to deliver thetherapy. The processes we describe herein could be adopted by other centers thatchoose to prescribe T. laherparepvec.METHODS: We studied our clinical trial experience with T. laherparepvec before weembarked on using commercially available T. laherparepvec. We created a standardoperating procedure (SOP) with multidisciplinary buy-in and oversight fromleadership in Infection Control at our institution. We reflected on clinicalcases and the actual procedures of administering T. laherparepvec to create theSOP.RESULTS: The preimplementation planning, patient selection, identification oflesions to treat, the actual procedure, and ongoing assessment of patients aredescribed. Tumoral-related factors that lead to unique challenges are described.CONCLUSIONS: A process to ensure safe and responsible implementation of a programto administer T. laherparepvec for treatment of melanoma may improve the qualityof treatment for patients who suffer from advanced melanoma."

To most significantly affectpopulation health, these trainings need to reach practitioners who may havelimited access to on-site trainings. Despite the number of organizations offeringtrainings, little is known about how to scale up trainings to efficiently extendtheir reach or how to tailor trainings to the needs of different intervention.The Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network and its collaborating centershave developed a training curriculum and delivered it in both in-person anddistance formats to a range of audiences. The purpose of this article is todescribe the training curriculum and findings from the Network's evaluation ofapproaches used to scale up delivery of the ""Putting Public Health Evidence inAction"" curriculum and tailor content for specific evidence-based interventions."

Medical recordswere reviewed uniformly, and the following data were collected: age, sex,episodes of urinary symptoms, tumor size, number of tumors, location of thelargest tumor (lateral walls, base, posterior wall, dome, and anterior wall),tumor appearance (papillary or non-papillary, pedunculated or sessile), andurinary cytology. Data from  patients (Group A) were used for the developmentof a nomogram, while data from  patients (Group B) were used for its externalvalidation.RESULTS: High-grade papillary bladder cancer was pathologically diagnosed in .and .% of Group A and Group B patients, respectively. Based on univariableanalyses in Group A, macrohematuria, tumor size, multiple tumors, appearance, andpositive urinary cytology were selected as variables to incorporate into anomogram.

" The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center","T-cell Homing Therapy for Reducing Regulatory T Cells and Preserving EffectorT-cell Function in Large Solid Tumors.","Purpose: Infused autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) andtumor-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells typically surroundmalignant lesions or penetrate small tumor nodules but fail to penetrate largesolid tumors, significantly compromising their antitumor impact. Strategies toovercome this primary challenge are largely required.Experimental Design: Wetested the effects of IL plus doxorubicin on T-cell penetration and efficacy insolid tumors in a murine lung cancer model, a murine breast carcinoma lungmetastasis model, and two human xenograft tumor models bearing large tumors (>mm).Results: Intriguingly, this simple approach increased the numbers, thedistribution, and the depth of penetration of infused CD+ T cells in thesetumors, including both TILs and CAR T cells. This combined treatment halted tumorprogression and significantly extended survival time. Studies of the underlyingmechanism revealed multiple effects. First, the combined treatment maintained thehigh ratios of immune-stimulatory receptors to immune-inhibitory receptors oninfiltrated CD+ T cells, reduced the accumulation of immunosuppressiveregulatory T cells, and enhanced the numbers of T-bet+ effector T cells in thetumors. Second, doxorubicin induced chemokines CXCL and CXCL, which mayattract NKGD+CD+ T cells to tumors, and this effect was boosted by IL-inducedIFNγ accumulation in tumors, promoting the penetration of NKGD+CD+ Tcells.Conclusions: The deep penetration of infused T cells associated withcombined IL plus doxorubicin yielded striking therapeutic effects in murine andhuman xenograft solid tumors. This approach might broaden the application ofT-cell therapy to a wider range of solid tumors. Clin Cancer Res; ();-. © AACRSee related commentary by Berraondo et al., p. ."

However,while preclinical studies have established that SDG and ENL affect measures ofprogression in models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC, a subset ofERα-negative disease), the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects remainunclear.METHODS: CBL/ mice were fed a control diet (control, % kcal from fat) orcontrol diet + SDG (SDG,  mg/kg diet) for  weeks, then orthotopicallyinjected with syngeneic E mammary tumor cells (a model of TNBC); tumor growthwas monitored for  weeks.

" University of Tennessee Medical Center Knoxville","Uterine weight and complications after abdominal, laparoscopic, and vaginalhysterectomy.","BACKGROUND: Although uterine size has been a previously cited barrier tominimally invasive hysterectomy, experienced gynecologic surgeons have been ableto demonstrate that laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomy is feasible withincreasingly large uteri. By demonstrating that minimally invasive hysterectomycontinues to have superior outcomes even with increased uterine weights,opportunity exists to meaningfully decrease morbidity, mortality, and costassociated with abdominal hysterectomy.OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if there is an association between uterineweight and posthysterectomy complications and if differences in that associationexist across vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal approaches.STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cohort study of prospectively collected qualityimprovement data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical QualityImprovement Program database, composed of patient information and -daypostoperative outcomes from > hospitals across the United States and targeteddata files, which includes additional data on procedure-specific risk factors andoutcomes in > of those participating hospitals. We analyzed patientsundergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions from  through , identifiedby Current Procedural Terminology code. We excluded patients who had cancer,surgery by a nongynecology specialty, or missing uterine weight. Patients werecompared with respect to -day postoperative complications and uterine weight,stratified by surgical approach. Bivariable tests and multivariable logisticregression were used for analysis.RESULTS: In all, , patients were analyzed. After adjusting for potentialconfounders, including medical and surgical variables, women with -g uteriwere >% more likely to have complications compared to women with uteri ≤ g(adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval, .-.; P < .), womenwith -g uteri were nearly % as likely (adjusted odds ratio, .; %confidence interval, .-.; P < .), and women with uteri ≥ g were>% more likely (adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval, .-.;P < .). The incidence of -day postsurgical complications was nearly doublein the abdominal hysterectomy group (%) compared to the laparoscopic group(%). Additionally, for each stratum of uterine weight, abdominal hysterectomyhad significantly higher odds of any complication compared to laparoscopichysterectomy, even after adjusting for potential demographic, medical, andsurgical confounders. For uteri < g, abdominal hysterectomy had twice the oddsof any complication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio,.; % confidence interval, .-.), and among women with uteri between- g, abdominal hysterectomy was associated with an almost % increase inodds of any complication (adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval,.-.). Even among women with uteri > g, abdominal hysterectomy was stillassociated with a >% increased odds of any complication, compared tolaparoscopic hysterectomy (adjusted odds ratio, .; % confidence interval,.-.).CONCLUSION: We found that while uterine weight was an independent risk factor forposthysterectomy complications, abdominal hysterectomy had higher odds of anycomplication, compared to laparoscopic hysterectomy, even for markedly enlargeduteri. Our study suggests that uterine weight alone is not an appropriateindication for abdominal hysterectomy. We also identified that it is safe toperform larger hysterectomies laparoscopically. Patients may benefit fromreferral to experienced surgeons who are able to offer laparoscopic hysterectomyeven for markedly enlarged uteri."

Due to the complex nature ofOM, currently available drug-based treatments are of limited efficacy.OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were (i) to determine genes and molecular pathwaysassociated with OM and wound healing using computational tools and publiclyavailable data and (ii) to identify drugs formulated for topical use targetingthe relevant OM molecular pathways.METHODS: OM and wound healing-associated genes were determined by text mining,and the intersection of the two gene sets was selected for gene ontology analysisusing the GeneCodis program. Protein interaction network analysis was performedusing STRING-db. Enriched gene sets belonging to the identified pathways werequeried against the Drug-Gene Interaction database to find drug candidates fortopical use in OM.RESULTS: Our analysis identified  genes common to both the ""OM"" and ""woundhealing"" text mining concepts. Gene enrichment analysis yielded  genesrepresenting six pathways and targetable by a total of  drugs which couldpossibly be formulated for topical application. A manual search onClinicalTrials.gov confirmed no relevant pathway/drug candidate had beenoverlooked. Twenty-five of the  drugs can directly affect the PTGS (COX-)pathway, the pathway that has been targeted in previous clinical trials withlimited success.CONCLUSIONS: Drug discovery using in silico text mining and pathway analysistools can facilitate the identification of existing drugs that have the potentialof topical administration to improve OM treatment."

In a recent genotype-phenotype study, we classified % of KEAPmutations as ANCHOR mutants. By immunoprecipitation, these mutants bind more NRFthan wild-type KEAP and ubiquitylate NRF, but are incapable of promoting NRFdegradation. BioID-based protein interaction studies confirmed increasedabundance of NRF within the KEAP ANCHOR mutant complexes with no otherstatistically significant changes to the complexes. Discrete molecular dynamicsimulation modeling and limited proteolysis suggest that the ANCHOR mutationsstabilize residues in KEAP that contact NRF. The modeling supports anintramolecular salt bridge between the RC ANCHOR mutation and E; mutationof the E residue confirmed the model, resulting in the ANCHOR phenotype. Inlive cells, the KEAP RQ and RC ANCHOR mutants co-localize with NRF,p/SQSTM, and polyubiquitin in structured spherical droplets that rapidly fuseand dissolve. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with confocal fluorescentimaging revealed membraneless phase-separated biomolecular condensates.

All positive blood cultures from RCWMCHoncology patients taken in  to  were retrieved to identify BSI cases.RESULTS: From  positive cultures,  BSI episodes were identified amongst patients; .% of the culture isolates were gram-positive bacteria, .% weregram-negative bacteria and .% fungal. Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus andViridans Group Streptococcus were the commonest gram-positive isolates.Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species were the commonest gram-negativeisolates. The majority of BSI episodes occurred in patients with haematologicalmalignancies (%), in the presence of severe neutropaenia (.%) and wasassociated with chemotherapy (%). Complications occurred in % of BSI. Fungalinfections had the highest prevalence of complications (.%). Three childrendied during BSI giving a case-fatality rate of %.CONCLUSION: BSI in our patients are mainly caused by gram-positive bacteria andassociated with a low case-fatality rate.

Multivariable logistic regression was used to examineassociations between region and prostate inflammation, and between region andprostate cancer risk at -year biopsy.Results: Prevalence of prostateinflammation varied across region, with broadly similar patterns for acute andchronic inflammation. Relative to Europe, prevalence of acute inflammation washigher in North America [odds ratio (OR), .; % confidence interval (CI),.-.] and Australia/New Zealand (OR, .; % CI, .-.).

" Colorado State University","Adaptation of the Possibilities for Activity Scale for women encountering cancer(PActS-W).","BACKGROUND/AIM: The original Possibilities for Activity Scale (PActS) examinedthe internalised societal pressures of older adults with cancer. Previousresearch found that scores from the original PActS scale were associated withparticipation in meaningful activity. Women of working age may have differentsocietal pressures than older adults, which could impact their quality of life.Our aims were to (i) adapt the scale specifically for women, (ii) test convergentand structural validity and (iii) test internal consistency reliability.METHOD: First, we completed a literature review to add new items, then measuredpsychometric properties of PActS-W.FINDINGS: A total of  women, one month after cancer surgery completed PActS-W.PActS-W demonstrated convergent-related (physical health r = ., mental healthr = ., P < .), structural validity (CFI, .; RMSEA, .; IFI, ., NFI,.) and high internal consistency reliability (stratified coefficientα = .).CONCLUSION: The PActS-W may be useful for measuring women's internalised societalpressures after encountering cancer, which relates to their quality of life, butfurther testing is needed."

The aim of this paper is to produce a 'report card' onCanada's success in reducing socioeconomic and health inequities pertaining tothese seven policy domains, and to assess how Canadian trends compare to those inthe United Kingdom (UK), a country with a similar health and welfare system.Summarising evidence from published studies and national statistics, we foundthat Canada's best successes were in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in earlylearning and child care and reproductive health-specifically in improving equityin maternal employment and infant mortality. Comparative data suggest thatCanada's outcomes in the latter areas were like those in the UK. In contrast,Canada's least promising equity outcomes were in relation to health hazardcontrol (specifically, tobacco) and child poverty. Though Canada and the UKobserved similar inequities in smoking, Canada's slow upward trend in childpoverty prevalence is distinct from the UK's small but steady reduction of childpoverty.

" Baylor College of Medicine","FGFR-Activated Translation of WNT Pathway Components with Structured ' UTRs IsVulnerable to Inhibition of EIFA-Dependent Translation Initiation.","Cooperativity between WNT and FGF signaling is well documented in embryonicdevelopment and cancer progression, but the molecular mechanisms underlying thiscross-talk remain elusive. In this study, we interrogated the dynamics of RNAlevels, ribosome occupancy, and protein expression as a function of inducible FGFsignaling in mouse mammary glands with constitutive WNT hyperactivation.Multiomics correlation analysis revealed a substantial discrepancy between RNAand ribosome occupancy levels versus protein levels. However, this discrepancydecreased as cells became premalignant and dynamically responded to FGFsignaling, implicating the importance of stringent gene regulation innontransformed cells. Analysis of individual genes demonstrated that acute FGFhyperactivation increased translation of many stem cell self-renewal regulators,including WNT signaling components, and decreased translation of genes regulatingcellular senescence. WNT pathway components translationally upregulated by FGFsignaling had long and structured ' UTRs with a high frequency of polypurinesequences, several of which harbored (CGG) motifs that can fold into eitherstable G-quadruplexes or other stable secondary structures. The FGF-mediatedincrease in translation of WNT pathway components was compromised by silvestrol,an inhibitor of EIFA that clamps EIFA to polypurine sequences to block Sscanning and inhibits its RNA-unwinding activity important for translationinitiation. Moreover, silvestrol treatment significantly delayed FGF-WNT-driventumorigenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that FGF signalingselectively enhances translation of structured mRNAs, particularly WNT signalingcomponents, and highlight their vulnerability to inhibitors that target the RNAhelicase EIFA.Significance: The RNA helicase EIFA may serve as a therapeutictarget for breast cancers that require FGF and WNT signaling.

SCCOHT ischaracterized by a diploid genome with loss of SMARCA and lack of SMARCAexpression, two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelingcomplex. We and others have identified the histone methyltransferase EZH as apromising therapeutic target for SCCOHT, suggesting that SCCOHT cells depend onthe alternation of epigenetic pathways for survival. In this study, we found thatSCCOHT cells were more sensitive to pan-HDAC inhibitors compared to other ovariancancer lines or immortalized cell lines tested. Pan-HDAC inhibitors, such asquisinostat, reversed the expression of a group of proteins that were deregulatedin SCCOHT cells due to SMARCA loss, leading to growth arrest, apoptosis anddifferentiation in vitro and suppressed tumor growth of xenografted tumors ofSCCOHT cells. Moreover, combined treatment of HDAC inhibitors and EZH inhibitorsat sub-lethal doses synergistically induced histone HK acetylation and targetgene expression, leading to rapid induction of apoptosis and growth suppressionof SCCOHT cells and xenografted tumors.

" University of Kansas","Natural product derivative Gossypolone inhibits Musashi family of RNA-bindingproteins.","BACKGROUND: The Musashi (MSI) family of RNA-binding proteins is best known forthe role in post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. Elevated MSI levelsin a variety of human cancer are associated with up-regulation of Notch/Wntsignaling. MSI binds to and negatively regulates translation of Numb and APC(adenomatous polyposis coli), negative regulators of Notch and Wnt signalingrespectively.METHODS: Previously, we have shown that the natural product (-)-gossypol as thefirst known small molecule inhibitor of MSI that down-regulates Notch/Wntsignaling and inhibits tumor xenograft growth in vivo. Using a fluorescencepolarization (FP) competition assay, we identified gossypolone (Gn) witha > -fold increase in Ki value compared to (-)-gossypol. We validated Gnbinding to MSI using surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, andcellular thermal shift assay, and tested the effects of Gn on colon cancer cellsand colon cancer DLD- xenografts in nude mice.RESULTS: In colon cancer cells, Gn reduced Notch/Wnt signaling and inducedapoptosis. Compared to (-)-gossypol, the same concentration of Gn is less activein all the cell assays tested. To increase Gn bioavailability, we used PEGylatedliposomes in our in vivo studies. Gn-lip via tail vein injection inhibited thegrowth of human colon cancer DLD- xenografts in nude mice, as compared to theuntreated control (P < ., n = ).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that PEGylation improved the bioavailability of Gnas well as achieved tumor-targeted delivery and controlled release of Gn, whichenhanced its overall biocompatibility and drug efficacy in vivo.

We validated Gnbinding to MSI using surface plasmon resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, andcellular thermal shift assay, and tested the effects of Gn on colon cancer cellsand colon cancer DLD- xenografts in nude mice.RESULTS: In colon cancer cells, Gn reduced Notch/Wnt signaling and inducedapoptosis. Compared to (-)-gossypol, the same concentration of Gn is less activein all the cell assays tested. To increase Gn bioavailability, we used PEGylatedliposomes in our in vivo studies. Gn-lip via tail vein injection inhibited thegrowth of human colon cancer DLD- xenografts in nude mice, as compared to theuntreated control (P < ., n = ).CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that PEGylation improved the bioavailability of Gnas well as achieved tumor-targeted delivery and controlled release of Gn, whichenhanced its overall biocompatibility and drug efficacy in vivo. This providesproof of concept for the development of Gn-lip as a molecular therapy for coloncancer with MSI/MSI overexpression."

During the study period, therate of esophagectomy decreased from .% to .% (P = .) in patients between and  years old, from .% to .% (P = .) in patients between  and years old, and from .% to .% (P = .) in patients older than  years.After accounting for patient and cancer characteristics, patients older than years were % less likely to undergo esophagectomy compared with both patientsbetween  and  years old (risk ratio [RR] ., % confidence interval [CI].-., P < .) and patients between  and  years old (RR ., % CI.-., P < .).CONCLUSION: Surgical resection is scarcely used in patients older than  yearsin the United States. Further investigation of surgical outcomes in elderlypatients is warranted to determine if surgical treatment is underutilized in alarge proportion of EAC patients."

" University of California San Francisco","Effect of apalutamide on health-related quality of life in patients withnon-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an analysis of the SPARTANrandomised, placebo-controlled, phase  trial.","BACKGROUND: In the SPARTAN trial, addition of apalutamide to androgen deprivationtherapy, as compared with placebo plus androgen deprivation therapy,significantly improved metastasis-free survival in men with non-metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer who were at high risk for development ofmetastases. We aimed to investigate the effects of apalutamide versus placeboadded to androgen deprivation therapy on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).METHODS: SPARTAN is a multicentre, international, randomised, phase  trial.Participants were aged  years or older, with non-metastaticcastration-resistant prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen doubling timeof  months or less, and a prostate-specific antigen concentration of  ng/mL ormore in serum. Patients were randomly assigned (:) to  mg oral apalutamideper day plus androgen deprivation therapy, or matched oral placebo plus androgendeprivation therapy, using an interactive voice randomisation system. Permutedblock randomisation was used according to the three baseline stratificationfactors: prostate-specific antigen doubling time (> months vs ≤ months), use ofbone-sparing drugs (yes vs no), and presence of local-regional nodal disease (Nvs N). Each treatment cycle was  days. The primary endpoint wasmetastasis-free survival. The trial was unblinded in July, . In thisprespecified exploratory analysis we assessed HRQOL using the FunctionalAssessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-D-L questionnaires, whichwe collected at baseline, day  of cycle  (before dose), day  of treatmentcycles -, day  of every two cycles from cycles  to , and day  of everyfour cycles thereafter. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT.FINDINGS: Between Oct , , and Dec , , we randomly assigned patients to receive apalutamide (n=) or placebo (n=). The clinical cutoffdate, as for the primary analysis, was May , . Median follow-up for overallsurvival was · months (IQR ·-·). FACT-P total and subscale scores wereassociated with a preservation of HRQOL from baseline to cycle  in theapalutamide group; there were similar results for EQ-D-L. At baseline, the meanfor FACT-P total score in both the apalutamide and placebo groups were consistentwith the FACT-P general population norm for US adult men. Group meanpatient-reported outcome scores over time show that HRQOL was maintained frombaseline after initiation of apalutamide treatment and was similar over timeamong patients receiving apalutamide versus placebo.

The authors review the known literature on seminoma metastatic to theorbit, and describe an additional case in a -year-old man.METHODS: A literature search was performed on the MEDLINE database using keywords""seminoma,"" ""testicular germ-cell tumors,"" ""testicular cancer,"" ""testicularneoplasm,"" ""orbital metastasis,"" and ""germ-cell neoplasms.""RESULTS: Malignant neoplasms of the testis account for only % of cancers in men.None-the-less, testicular germ cell seminoma is the most common solid tumor foundin young men between the ages of  and . Only seven previous cases have beenmentioned in the literature. The pathogenesis remains unclear although genetic,environmental, and maternal factors may play a role. The number of cases is toofew to determine the best treatment options, but surgical excision and adjunctiveorbital radiotherapy appear to be most appropriate.CONCLUSIONS: Although metastases to the orbit are rare, seminoma should beconsidered in the differential diagnosis of all young men with proptosis."
" Dalhousie University","Survivorship care plans: are randomized controlled trials assessing outcomes thatare relevant to stakeholders?","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes assessed in extantrandomized controlled trials (RCTs) to outcomes that stakeholders expect fromsurvivorship care plans (SCPs). To facilitate the transition from activetreatment to follow-up care for the . million US cancer survivors, manyorganizations require SCP use. However, results of several RCTs of SCPs'effectiveness have been null, possibly because they have evaluated outcomes onwhich SCPs should be expected to have limited influence. Stakeholders (e.g.,survivors, oncologists) may expect outcomes that differ from RCTs' outcomes.METHODS: We identified RCTs' outcomes using a PubMed literature review. Weidentified outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs using semistructuredinterviews with stakeholders in three healthcare systems in the USA and Canada.Finally, we mapped RCTs' outcomes onto stakeholder-identified outcomes.RESULTS: RCT outcomes did not fully address outcomes that stakeholders expectedfrom SCPs, and RCTs assessed outcomes that stakeholders did not expect from SCPs.RCTs often assessed outcomes only from survivors' perspectives.CONCLUSIONS: RCTs of SCPs' effectiveness have not assessed outcomes thatstakeholders expect. To better understand SCPs' effectiveness, future RCTs shouldassess outcomes of SCP use that are relevant from the perspective of multiplestakeholders.IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: SCPs' effectiveness may be optimized when usedwith an eye toward outcomes that stakeholders expect from SCPs. For survivors,this means using SCPs as a map to guide them with respect to what kind offollow-up care they should seek, when they should seek it, and from whom theyshould seek it."

" Oncology Institute","The Persistent Problem of Local/Regional Failure After Surgical Intervention forEarly-Stage Lung Cancer.","BACKGROUND: The goal of the present study was to estimate the rate oflocal/regional failure (LRF) after definitive surgical intervention forearly-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), without postoperativeradiotherapy, in the era of contemporary imaging and minimally invasive surgicaltechniques.METHODS: Medical records of patients with early-stage NSCLC (pathologic T-,N-) who underwent lobectomy, sleeve lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy,with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, between  and , wereretrospectively reviewed. LRF was defined as recurrence at the ipsilateral lung,bronchial stump, mediastinum, chest wall, or supraclavicular region. TheKaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to LRF, with patients censored atdeath, and log-rank tests were used for comparisons. A two-sided p value of lessthan . was considered significant.RESULTS: Included were  patients (median age,  years). Preoperative stagingwith positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed in % ofpatients, mediastinoscopy was performed in %, and video-assisted thoracoscopicsurgery was performed in %. At a median follow-up of  months (range,  to months), the -year estimated LRF was % (% confidence interval, % to %).LRF rates were not significantly different in those with and without stagingpositron emission tomography/computed tomography (hazard ratio, .; p = .)and those with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy(hazard ratio, .; p = .).CONCLUSIONS: Despite contemporary staging procedures and surgical techniques forearly-stage NSCLC, LRF occurs in approximately  of  patients. The observedrates of LRF are similar to those reported more than a decade ago, suggestingthat local/regional control remains a persistent problem. The use of additionallocal treatments, such as radiotherapy, should be reevaluated to further improveoutcomes."
" The University of Virginia","Deadly DAaRTS destroy cancer cells via a tumor microenvironment-mediated trigger.","Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment play a supportive role in tumorgrowth, progression, and treatment resistance; therefore, these nonmalignantcells are potential therapeutic targets. In this issue of the JCI, Szot et al.devised a strategy to exploit the cell-surface marker TEM (also known asANTXR), which is expressed by cancer-associated stromal cells, as a zip code todeliver an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) linked to the potent cancer-killing drugmonomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In preclinical tumor and experimental metastasismodels of multiple cancer types, TEM-ADC targeted TEM-expressingcancer-associated stromal cells, which processed and liberated membrane-permeableMMAE and released this drug via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter.Released MMAE killed cancer cells through a bystander mechanism that did minimaldamage to the stromal cells themselves. P-gp-expressing tumor cells displayedMMAE resistance, suggesting that P-gp expression status may identify patients whomight benefit the most from TEM-ADC. This strategy, termed DAaRTS (drugactivation and release through stroma), represents an elegant example of howselective expression of a cell-surface molecule on cancer-associated stroma canbe exploited to facilitate drug delivery and shrink solid tumors."

" Hospital Alemán of Buenos Aires","Esophageal Cancer Surgery: Spontaneous Centralization in the US Contributed toReduce Mortality Without Causing Health Disparities.","BACKGROUND: Improvement in mortality has been shown for esophagectomies performedat high-volume centers.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if centralization of esophageal cancersurgery occurred in the US, and to establish its impact on postoperativemortality. In addition, we aimed to analyze the relationship betweenregionalization of cancer care and health disparities.METHODS: A retrospective population-based analysis was performed using theNational Inpatient Sample for the period -. Adult patients (≥  years ofage) diagnosed with esophageal cancer and who underwent esophagectomy wereincluded. Yearly hospital volume was categorized as low (<  procedures),intermediate (- procedures), and high (>  procedures). Multivariableanalyses on the potential effect of hospital volume on patient outcomes wereperformed, and the yearly rate of esophagectomies was estimated using Poissonregression.RESULTS: A total of  patients were included. Esophagectomy at low- [oddsratio (OR) .] and intermediate-volume (OR .) hospitals, compared withhigh-volume hospitals, was associated with a significant increase in mortality.The percentage of esophagectomies performed at high-volume centers significantlyincreased during the study period (.-.%; p < .). The trend towardshigh-volume hospitals was different among the different US regions: South(.-.%), West (.-.%), Midwest (.-.%), and Northeast (.-.%)[p < .]. Overall, the mortality rate of esophagectomy dropped from . to.% (p = .), with non-White race, public insurance, and low household incomepatients also showing a significant reduction in mortality.CONCLUSIONS: A spontaneous centralization for esophageal cancer surgery occurredin the US. This process was associated with a decrease in the mortality rate,without contributing to health disparities."

New interventions based onnovel targets are needed. We aim to identify new genetic determinants of overallsurvival (OS) in patients after treatment with gemcitabine using genome-widescreens of germline DNA. We aim also to support these findings with in vitrofunctional analysis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide screens of germline DNA in two independentcohorts of pancreatic cancer patients (from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B(CALGB)  and the Mayo Clinic) were used to select new genes associated withOS. The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) was selected, and the interactions ofgenetic variation in VDR with circulating vitamin D levels and gemcitabinetreatment were evaluated.

" Purdue University School of Pharmacy and the Purdue Center for Cancer Research","Characterization and structure-activity relationships ofindenoisoquinoline-derived topoisomerase I inhibitors in unsilencing the dormantUbea gene associated with Angelman syndrome.","Background: Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorderlacking effective therapies. AS is caused by mutations in ubiquitin proteinligase EA (UBEA), which is genomically imprinted such that only the maternallyinherited copy is expressed in neurons. We previously demonstrated thattopoisomerase I (Top) inhibitors could successfully reactivate the dormantpaternal allele of Ubea in neurons of a mouse model of AS. We also previouslyshowed that one such Top inhibitor, topotecan, could unsilence paternal UBEA ininduced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from individuals with AS. Althoughtopotecan has been well-studied and is FDA-approved for cancer therapy, itslimited CNS bioavailability will likely restrict the therapeutic use of topotecanin AS. The goal of this study was to identify additional Top inhibitors withsimilar efficacy as topotecan, with the expectation that these could be tested inthe future for safety and CNS bioavailability to assess their potential as AStherapeutics.Methods: We tested  indenoisoquinoline-derived Top inhibitors to identifycompounds that unsilence the paternal allele of Ubea in mouse neurons. Primarycortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day . (E.) mice with aUbea-YFP fluorescent tag on the paternal allele (Ubeam+/pYFP mice) or mice thatlack the maternal Ubea allele and hence model AS (Ubeam-/p+ mice). Neurons werecultured for  days, treated with drug for  h, and examined for paternal UBEAprotein expression by Western blot or fluorescence immunostaining. Dose responsesof the compounds were determined across a log range of drug treatments, andcytotoxicity was tested using a luciferase-based assay.Results: All  indenoisoquinoline-derived Top inhibitors unsilenced paternalUbea. Several compounds exhibited favorable paternal Ubea unsilencingproperties, similar to topotecan, and of these, indotecan (LMP) was the mosteffective based on estimated Emax (maximum response of unsilencing paternalUbea) and EC (half maximal effective concentration).Conclusions: We provide pharmacological profiles of indenoisoquinoline-derivedTop inhibitors as paternal Ubea unsilencers. All  tested compounds wereeffective at unsilencing paternal Ubea, although with variable efficacy andpotency. Indotecan (LMP) demonstrated a better pharmacological profile ofUbea unsilencing compared to our previous lead compound, topotecan. Takentogether, indotecan and its structural analogues are potential AS therapeuticswhose translational potential in AS treatment should be further assessed."

"Cedars-Sinai Medical Center","The case against endometrial ablation for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Endometrial ablation is a common treatment for heavy menstrualbleeding, but serious limitations and long-term complications exist. Our purposeis to summarize the use of endometrial ablation devices, potential short-term andlong-term complications, cost effectiveness, and quality of life in relation toalternative treatments.RECENT FINDINGS: There is insufficient evidence to strongly recommend oneendometrial ablation device over another. Providers should consider and discusswith their patients, complications including risk of future pregnancy,endometrial cancer, and hysterectomy for continued bleeding or pain. Patientselection is key to reducing postablation pain and failure; patients with ahistory of tubal ligation and dysmenorrhea should consider alternativetreatments. All patients should also be counseled that the levonorgestrelintrauterine device is a cost-effective alternative with higher quality of lifeand fewer complications. Hysterectomy is definitive treatment with higher qualityof life and fewer complications.SUMMARY: Although endometrial ablation can offer adequate symptom control forpatients who have failed medical therapy, desire uterine preservation, or who arehigh-risk surgical candidates, patients should be appropriately selected andcounseled regarding the potential for treatment failure and long-termcomplications."

Thenumber of normal lymph nodes could indicate the number of nodes that need to beretrieved during the procedure. The aim of this study is to analyze the number oflymph nodes in cadavers without gastric cancer according to the Japanese GastricCancer Association guidelines. Twenty fresh adult cadavers ( males, mean age, range - years) were used. Abdominal lymph nodes were dissected andclassified according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. For totalgastrectomy, the median number of lymph nodes that comprised D + dissection was (range -). The median and mean number of lymph nodes that comprised Ddissection was , ranging from  to . For distal gastrectomy, the D + levelcomprised a median of  lymph nodes (range -), and the D level  lymphnodes (range -). In conclusion, considering gastrectomy + D lymphadenectomyas the standard treatment for gastric cancer, our results show that adequatelymphadenectomy must encompass around  lymph nodes. Clin.

"UNC-HIV Cure Center","γδ T cells: an immunotherapeutic approach for HIV cure strategies.","Current strategies aimed to cure HIV infection are based on combined efforts toreactivate the virus from latency and improve immune effector cell function toclear infected cells. These strategies are primarily focused on CD+ T cells andapproaches are challenging due to insufficient HIV antigen production frominfected cells and poor HIV-specific CD+ T cells. γδ T cells represent a uniquesubset of effector T cells that can traffic to tissues, and selectively targetcancer or virally infected cells without requiring MHC presentation. We analyzedwhether γδ T cells represent a complementary/alternative immunotherapeuticapproach towards HIV cure strategies. γδ T cells from HIV-infected virologicallysuppressed donors were expanded with bisphosphonate pamidronate (PAM) and cellswere used in autologous cellular systems ex vivo. These cells (a) are potentcytotoxic effectors able to efficiently inhibit HIV replication ex vivo, (b)degranulate in the presence of autologous infected CD+ T cells, and (c)specifically clear latently infected cells after latency reversal withvorinostat. This is the first proof of concept to our knowledge showing that γδ Tcells target and clear autologous HIV reservoirs upon latency reversal. Ourresults open potentially new insights into the immunotherapeutic use of γδ Tcells for current interventions in HIV eradication strategies."

The aim of this study was toevaluate the relationship between the Mediterranean diet (MED) and DietaryApproaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet scores and prostate canceraggressiveness by race.METHODS: Data from the population-based, case-only North Carolina-LouisianaProstate Cancer Project (PCaP) were used to examine the association between dietquality, measured by MED and DASH scores, and prostate cancer aggressiveness in African American (AA) and European American (EA) research subjects. Dietaryintake was assessed using a modified National Cancer Institute Diet HistoryQuestionnaire. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios(ORs) and % confidence intervals (CIs) for high versus low-intermediateaggressive prostate cancer.RESULTS: Higher MED scores were inversely associated with high aggressiveprostate cancer overall (OR: .; % CI: ., . for high versus lowscores); results were similar for AA and EA men.

" Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","Evaluation of Interventions Intended to Increase Colorectal Cancer ScreeningRates in the United States: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","Importance: Colorectal cancer screening (CRC) is recommended by all major USmedical organizations but remains underused.Objective: To identify interventions associated with increasing CRC screeningrates and their effect sizes.Data Sources: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature,the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from January , ,to August , . Key search terms included colorectal cancer and screening.Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials of US-based interventions in clinicalsettings designed to improve CRC screening test completion in average-riskadults.Data Extraction and Synthesis: At least  investigators independently extracteddata and appraised each study's risk of bias. Where sufficient data wereavailable, random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain either a pooled riskratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) for screening completion for each type ofintervention.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was completion of CRC screening.Examination included interventions to increase completion of () initial CRCscreening by any recommended modality, () colonoscopy after an abnormal initialscreening test result, and () continued rounds of annual fecal blood tests(FBTs).Results: The main review included  randomized clinical trials comprising  patients at low or medium risk of bias. Interventions that wereassociated with increased CRC screening completion rates compared with usual careincluded FBT outreach (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%),patient navigation (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%),patient education (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%), patientreminders (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%), clinicianinterventions of academic detailing (RD, %; % CI, %-%), and clinicianreminders (RD, %; % CI, %-%). Combinations of interventions (clinicianinterventions or navigation added to FBT outreach) were associated with greaterincreases than single components (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI,%-%). Repeated mailed FBTs with navigation were associated with increasedannual FBT completion (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; % CI, %-%).Patient navigation was not associated with colonoscopy completion after aninitial abnormal screening test result (RR, .; % CI, .-.; RD, %; %CI, %-%).Conclusions and Relevance: Fecal blood test outreach and patient navigation,particularly in the context of multicomponent interventions, were associated withincreased CRC screening rates in US trials. Fecal blood test outreach should beincorporated into population-based screening programs. More research is needed oninterventions to increase adherence to continued FBTs, follow-up of abnormalinitial screening test results, and cost-effectiveness and other implementationbarriers for more intensive interventions, such as navigation."

The factors influencing livermetastasis of CRC are poorly characterized, but this information is urgentlyneeded. We have now discovered that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, exosomes)derived from CRC can be specifically targeted to liver tissue and induce livermacrophage polarization toward an interleukin- (IL-)-secreting pro-inflammatoryphenotype. More importantly, we found that microRNA--p (miR-) was highlyenriched in CRC-derived sEVs and was essential for creating a liverpro-inflammatory phenotype and liver metastasis of CRC. Silencing either miR-in CRC-sEVs or Toll-like receptor  (TLR) in macrophages, to which miR- binds,abolished CRC-sEVs' induction of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore,miR- expression in plasma-derived sEVs was positively correlated with livermetastasis in CRC patients. Collectively, our data demonstrate a pivotal role ofCRC-sEVs in promoting liver metastasis by inducing an inflammatory pre-metastaticniche through the miR--TLR-IL axis. Thus, sEVs-miR- represents a potentialprognostic marker and therapeutic target for CRC patients with liver metastasis."

" Zhejiang University School of Medicine","Colorectal Cancer-derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Establish an InflammatoryPre-metastatic Niche in Liver Metastasis.","Liver metastases develop in more than half of patients with colorectal cancer(CRC) and are associated with a poor prognosis. The factors influencing livermetastasis of CRC are poorly characterized, but this information is urgentlyneeded. We have now discovered that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, exosomes)derived from CRC can be specifically targeted to liver tissue and induce livermacrophage polarization toward an interleukin- (IL-)-secreting pro-inflammatoryphenotype. More importantly, we found that microRNA--p (miR-) was highlyenriched in CRC-derived sEVs and was essential for creating a liverpro-inflammatory phenotype and liver metastasis of CRC. Silencing either miR-in CRC-sEVs or Toll-like receptor  (TLR) in macrophages, to which miR- binds,abolished CRC-sEVs' induction of pro-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore,miR- expression in plasma-derived sEVs was positively correlated with livermetastasis in CRC patients.

Transcriptionally active ESR fusions therefore trigger bothendocrine therapy resistance and metastatic progression, explaining theassociation with fatal disease progression, although CDK/ inhibitor treatmentis predicted to be effective."
" Tufts University","Family History of MI, Smoking, and Risk of Periodontal Disease.","Periodontal disease (PD) shares common risk factors with cardiovascular disease.Our hypothesis was that having a family history of myocardial infarction(FamHxMI) may be a novel risk factor for PD.

Exploratory analysis with inflammatory biomarkers and genetic determinantswas conducted to understand potential mechanistic links. The Women's GenomeHealth Study (WGHS) is a prospective cohort of US female health careprofessionals who provided blood samples at baseline in the Women's Health Study,a  ×  factorial clinical trial investigating vitamin E and aspirin in theprevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. PD was ascertained viaself-report over  y of follow-up. Prevalence (, cases), incidence (,cases), and survival analysis of PD were investigated for associations of FamHxMIas well as in strata of FamHxMI by smoking. Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square tests,multivariate regression, and Cox proportional hazard models were used for theanalyses. In the WGHS, women with FamHxMI showed higher risk of ever having PD.

" Ruhr-University Bochum","Neoplasms Reported With Liraglutide or Placebo in People With Type  Diabetes:Results From the LEADER Randomized Trial.","OBJECTIVE: This study explored neoplasm risk with liraglutide versus placebo inthe LEADER (Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation ofCardiovascular Outcome Results) cohort.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: LEADER (NCT) was an international, phase b,randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. Participants aged ≥ years with type diabetes and high cardiovascular risk were assigned : to receive liraglutide(≤. mg daily; n = ,) or placebo (n = ,) in addition to standard careand monitored for .- years (median follow-up . years). The occurrence ofneoplasms was a prespecified, exploratory secondary end point. Post hoc analysesof the time to the first confirmed neoplasms were conducted using a Coxregression model.RESULTS: Neoplasm was confirmed in .% of patients with liraglutide versus .%with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] . [% CI .; .]). The HR (% CI) forliraglutide versus placebo was . (.; .) for malignant neoplasms and .(.; .) for benign neoplasms. Sensitivity analyses excluding neoplasmsoccurring < year or < years after randomization and analyses by sex providedsimilar results. In our main analyses, the % CI for the HR included one for allmalignant neoplasms evaluated (including pancreatic and thyroid neoplasms) exceptfor prostate neoplasms, which occurred in fewer liraglutide-treated patients.CONCLUSIONS: LEADER was not primarily designed to assess neoplasm risk. Firmconclusions cannot be made regarding numeric imbalances observed for individualneoplasm types (e.g., pancreatic cancer) that occurred infrequently. LEADER datado, however, exclude a major increase in the risk of total malignant neoplasmswith liraglutide versus placebo. Additional studies are needed to assesslonger-term exposure."

Wecategorized the content by the audience of forum posts (i.e., inwardly directed,those seeking support, vs. outwardly directed, those sharing personalexperiences) and constructed comparative effectiveness research questions fromthe submitted content.RESULTS: From  July  to  August , a total of  forum posts werecollected, of which  were excluded from analysis due to non-relevant content,leaving  comments for final analysis. Almost % of posts involvedmuscle-invasive bladder cancer and % of posts were from people other than thepatient. Inwardly and outwardly directed posts were commonly related to clinicaltreatment concerns.CONCLUSIONS: Review of online patient-generated content may offer insight intocomparative effectiveness research topics of importance to bladder cancerpatients. A more formalized process may better represent research prioritiesamong bladder cancer patients."
"Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine","Improved Tumor Purity Metrics in Next-generation Sequencing for ClinicalPractice: The Integrated Interpretation of Neoplastic Cellularity and SequencingResults (IINCaSe) Approach.","Neoplastic cellularity contributes to the analytic sensitivity of most presenttechnologies for mutation detection, such that they underperform when stroma andinflammatory cells dilute a cancer specimen's variant fraction. Thus, tumorpurity assessment by light microscopy is used to determine sample adequacy beforesequencing and to interpret the significance of negative results and mutantallele fraction afterwards. However, pathologist estimates of tumor purity areimprecise and have limited reproducibility. With the advent of massively parallelsequencing, large amounts of molecular data can be analyzed by computationalpurity algorithms. We retrospectively compared tumor purity of  computationalalgorithms with neoplastic cellularity using hematoxylin and eosin lightmicroscopy to determine which was best for clinical evaluation of molecularprofiling. Data were analyzed from  cancer patients from a clinical trialcohort, LCCC (UNCseq), whose tumors had targeted massively parallelsequencing. Concordance among algorithms was poor, and the specimens analyzed hadhigh rates of algorithm failure partially due to variable tumor purity.Computational tumor purity estimates did not add value beyond the pathologist'sestimate of neoplastic cellularity microscopy. To improve present methods, wepropose a semiquantitative, clinically applicable strategy based on mutant allelefraction and copy number changes present within a given specimen, which whencombined with the morphologic tumor purity estimate, guide the interpretation ofnext-generation sequencing results in cancer patients.This is an open-accessarticle distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-No Derivatives License .

Notably,we found that miR- expression was a driver of these  subtypes and, further,that miR- expression was particularly pronounced in epithelial cells. Colonoidsrevealed that miR- expression differences are preserved in this ex vivo system.In adult patients, low colonic miR- expression levels at the time of surgerywere associated with worse disease outcome as measured by need for an endileostomy and recurrence of disease in the neoterminal ileum. In pediatricpatients, lower miR- expression at the time of diagnosis was associated withfuture development of fibrostenotic ileal CD requiring surgeryCONCLUSIONS. Thesefindings represent an important step forward in designing more effective clinicaltrials and developing personalized CD therapies.FUNDING: This work was supported by CCF Career Development Award (SZS),R-ES from NIEHS (SZS and TSF), RDK-A from NIDDK (SZS andTSF), P-DK-A from NIDDK (SZS), P-DK from NIDDK (SZS),--ACE- ADA Pathway Award (PS), UNC Nutrition Obesity Research Center Pilot &Feasibility Grant PDK (PS), CCF PRO-KIIDS NETWORK (SZS and PS), UNC CGIBDT Training Grant from NIDDK (JBB), T Training Grant (TGM-) fromNIGMS (MH), and SHARE from the Helmsley Trust (SZS).

Theauthors used latent profile analysis (LPA) to group men according to theirsymptom burden and functional status and to identify patient characteristicsassociated with each HRQOL profile.METHODS: Patients completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement InformationSystem and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite measures  months aftertreatment initiation. Anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain,diarrhea, urinary obstruction, urinary incontinence, erectile function, and sexsatisfaction were modeled jointly using LPA, and the analysis was adjusted forcovariates to examine associations between patient characteristics and profiles.RESULTS: One-third of the  men were not non-Hispanic white (% were black).Four LPA profiles were identified. Men who experienced the ""best HRQOL"" were lesslikely to receive treatment, to be older, and to smoke. Men in the second bestprofile experienced symptoms similar to men in the best HRQOL group but reportedpoor sexual and urinary function, because they were more likely to receivetherapy. The third profile included men with increased symptom burden and poorfunctioning who were likely to undergo prostatectomy and to have increasedcomorbidity. The ""worst HRQOL"" group experienced the worst symptoms and thepoorest functioning, and these men were more likely to be younger, to have morecomorbidities, and to smoke.CONCLUSIONS: LPA revealed that men who receive the same treatment can experiencevery different HRQOL impact.

Inthe  American Community Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau reported there wereclose to . million Arab Americans living within the United States, a %increase in population size from . According to the Arab American Institute,currently, that estimate has grown to approximately . million. They have highrates of smoking and low rates of smoking cessation. In this study, theresearchers investigated factors influencing desire to quit smoking among ArabAmericans, and their association with acculturation and health beliefs.METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional descriptive study investigating smoking behaviorsand factors influencing the desire to quit smoking among adult Arab American.Data were collected to measure tobacco use, nicotine dependence, desire to quitsmoking, acculturation, and health beliefs.RESULTS: The sample ( N = ) was % female, mean age of  years (±.). Thedesire to quit smoking was positively associated with perceived severity (p <.) and susceptibility to cancer (p < .), perceived benefits of quittingsmoking ( p < .); and negatively associated with smoking barriers (addictionbarriers p < ., external barriers p = ., internal barriers p < .), andnicotine dependence (p < .). Being female, having a lower level of nicotinedependence, and a higher perception of cancer severity predicted higher desire toquit smoking ( p < .).DISCUSSION: Smoking cessation intervention studies need to target appropriatehealth beliefs, especially the high risk of cancer caused by smoking among ArabAmericans."

Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine endoscopistcharacteristics associated with serrated polyp detection.RESULTS:  A total of   colonoscopies were performed by  endoscopists whovaried with respect to specialty ( % were gastroenterologists), sex ( %female), years in practice (range  - ), and number of colonoscopies performedduring the study period (range  - ). The overall mean SPDR was . % (SD. %, range  - . %). In multivariable analysis, gastroenterology specialtytraining (odds ratio [OR] .,  % confidence interval [CI] . - .), feweryears in practice (≤  years vs. ≥  years: OR .,  %CI . - .)], andhigher procedure volumes (highest vs. lowest quartile: OR .,  %CI. - .)] were independently associated with serrated polyp detection.CONCLUSIONS:  Gastroenterology specialization, more recent completion oftraining, and greater procedure volume are associated with serrated polypdetection. These findings imply that both repetition and training are likely tobe important contributors to adequate detection of these important cancerprecursors. Additional efforts to improve SPDR are needed."

We aimed to compare the long-term survival outcomes betweendefinitive chemoradiation (dCR) and chemoradiation plus surgery (CRS) in patientswith stage III esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Using the National CancerInstitute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry,adults (≥  years old) with diagnosis of AJCC th edition stage III EAC (T/N,T/N, and T/N) between  and  were included. A multivariable Coxregression was used to assess the effect of dCR and CRS on mortality. Of the patients included,  (%) underwent Dcr, and  (%) underwent CRS. The-year survival rate was % for patients undergoing dCR and % for patientsundergoing CRS (p < .). Our observational data suggest that patients withstage III EAC may benefit by the use of esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy."

" University of Illinois","Multivalent Binding and Biomimetic Cell Rolling Improves the Sensitivity andSpecificity of Circulating Tumor Cell Capture.","Purpose: We aimed to examine the effects of multivalent binding and biomimeticcell rolling on the sensitivity and specificity of circulating tumor cell (CTC)capture. We also investigated the clinical significance of CTCs and their kineticprofiles in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment.ExperimentalDesign: Patients with histologically confirmed primary carcinoma undergoingradiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, were eligible for enrollment.Peripheral blood was collected prospectively at up to five time points, includingbefore radiotherapy, at the first week, mid-point and final week of treatment, aswell as  to  weeks after completion of radiotherapy. CTC capture wasaccomplished using a nanotechnology-based assay (CapioCyte) functionalized withaEpCAM, aHER-, and aEGFR.Results: CapioCyte was able to detect CTCs in all cancer patients enrolled. Multivalent binding via poly(amidoamine) dendrimersfurther improved capture sensitivity. We also showed that cell rolling effect canimprove CTC capture specificity (% of captured cells that are CK+/CD-/DAPI+) upto %. Among the  patients with sequential CTC measurements, the median CTCdecreased from  CTCs/mL before radiotherapy to  CTCs/mL at completion ofradiotherapy (P = .). CTCs declined throughout radiotherapy in patients withcomplete clinical and/or radiographic response, in contrast with an elevation inCTCs at mid or post-radiotherapy in the two patients with known pathologicresidual disease.Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that multivalent binding andcell rolling can improve the sensitivity and specificity of CTC capture comparedwith multivalent binding alone, allowing reliable monitoring of CTC changesduring and after treatment.

However, few studies to date have examinedwhether trajectories of CVD risk and major risk factors are worse among womenwith a breast cancer diagnosis compared with those without.METHODS: Changes in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, systolic bloodpressure, and -year CVD risk were compared between women with ( women) andwithout ( women) an incident breast cancer diagnosis while they were enrolledin the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Sister Study cohort.Blood pressure and adiposity measures were collected by trained examiners at anenrollment visit (≥ year before breast cancer diagnosis) and a second home visit to  years later (≥ year after breast cancer diagnosis). Thenon-laboratory-based Framingham risk score, a measure of -year general CVDrisk, was calculated at both the enrollment and second visits. All analyses werestratified by menopausal status at the time of enrollment.RESULTS: Women who were premenopausal at the time of enrollment experiencedmoderate increases in weight, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, andCVD risk over the study period. Those who were postmenopausal at the time ofenrollment demonstrated little change in weight, but were found to have increasesin waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and CVD risk. In both groups,changes over time did not differ significantly according to breast cancer status.Neither chemotherapy nor endocrine therapy were found to be associated withgreater increases in CVD risk or risk factors.CONCLUSIONS: In the current study cohort, changes over time in CVD risk,adiposity measures, and blood pressure were similar between women who developedan incident breast cancer and those who did not."
" Boston University School of Medicine ","Engaging parents around vaccine confidence: proceedings from the National HPVVaccination Roundtable meetings.","HPV vaccine uptake remains below national goals in the US, driven in part byparental uncertainty about the vaccine fueled by negative stories on social mediaand other information platforms. To identify opportunities for mobilizing parentsto increase HPV vaccination uptake, the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable andVaccinate Adolescents Against Cancers program convened two national meetings in at the American Cancer Society. Stakeholders recommended a focus on positivemessage to parents; cultivating parent champions to use the power of personalstorytelling and to distribute these messages; and defining the role of nationalorganizations in supporting parent champions.

"b HPV Vaccination and HPV VACs Program ","Engaging parents around vaccine confidence: proceedings from the National HPVVaccination Roundtable meetings.","HPV vaccine uptake remains below national goals in the US, driven in part byparental uncertainty about the vaccine fueled by negative stories on social mediaand other information platforms. To identify opportunities for mobilizing parentsto increase HPV vaccination uptake, the National HPV Vaccination Roundtable andVaccinate Adolescents Against Cancers program convened two national meetings in at the American Cancer Society. Stakeholders recommended a focus on positivemessage to parents; cultivating parent champions to use the power of personalstorytelling and to distribute these messages; and defining the role of nationalorganizations in supporting parent champions.

" RTI International","Barriers to accessing palliative care for pediatric patients with cancer: Areview of the literature.","Although many of the , children in the United States diagnosed who are withcancer each year could benefit from pediatric palliative care, these servicesremain underused. Evidence regarding the barriers impeding access tocomprehensive palliative care is dispersed in the literature, and evidencespecific to pediatric oncology remains particularly sparse. The purpose of thecurrent review was to synthesize the existing literature regarding these barriersand the strategies offered to address them. The authors completed a literaturesearch using the PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature(CINAHL), and Web of Science databases. In total,  articles were reviewed.Barriers to accessing pediatric palliative care were categorized according to the levels of a modified socioecological model (ie, barriers related topolicy/payment, health systems, organizations, and individuals). Major themesidentified at each level included: ) the lack of consistent and adequate fundingmechanisms at the policy/payment level, ) the lack of pediatric palliative careprograms and workforce at the health systems level, ) difficulties integratingpalliative care into existing pediatric oncology care models at theorganizational level, and ) the lack of knowledge about pediatric palliativecare, discomfort with talking about death, and cultural differences betweenproviders and patients and their families at the individual level.Recommendations to address each of the barriers identified in the literature areincluded.

" Duke University Medical Center","A Phase I Trial of the PIK Inhibitor Buparlisib Combined With Capecitabine inPatients With Metastatic Breast Cancer.","BACKGROUND: Buparlisib is an oral pan-class I phosphotidyinositol--kinase (PIK)inhibitor. The present phase I study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, andefficacy of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breastcancer.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received buparlisib once daily (range,  to mg) for  weeks with capecitabine twice daily (range,  to  mg/m) for weeks with a -week break. Dose escalation used a traditional "" + "" design withstandard definitions of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose.RESULTS: Of the  patients enrolled,  were evaluable for DLT and  wereevaluable for response. The maximum tolerated dose of the combination wasbuparlisib  mg daily and capecitabine  mg/m twice daily. DLTs includedgrade  hyperglycemia and grade  confusion. The most common grade  toxicitieswere diarrhea and elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alaninetransaminase. One patient exhibited a complete response to treatment and four hada confirmed partial response. In cohorts  and , in which the buparlisib doseremained constant but the capecitabine dose was increased, significant increasesin the buparlisib plasma concentration were noted.CONCLUSION: The combination of buparlisib with capecitabine in patients withmetastatic breast cancer was generally well-tolerated, with several patientsdemonstrating prolonged responses. Unexpectedly low rates of PIKCA mutations (of ) were seen, and only  of  tumors with subtyping were luminal, makingexploration of these putative predictive markers impossible. Further study of thecombination is not unreasonable, with expanded pharmacokinetics and sequencinganalysis to better elucidate potential drug-drug interactions and more accuratepredictive biomarkers of response."

" The Ohio State University","Chemotherapy-induced muscle wasting: association with NF-κB and cancer cachexia.","A compounding feature of greater than % of all cancers is the high incidence ofthe cachexia syndrome, a complex metabolic disorder characterized by extremeweight loss due mainly to the gross depletion of skeletal muscle tissue. Althoughstudies into the cause of cancer cachexia has spanned over multiple decades,little is known about the effects of various cancer treatments themselves oncachexia. For example, chemotherapy agents induce side effects such as nausea andanorexia, but these symptoms do not fully account for the changes seen withcancer cachexia. In this study we examine the effects of chemotherapeuticcompounds, specifically, cisplatin in the colon- adenocarcinoma model of cancercachexia. We find that although cisplatin is able to reduce tumor burden asexpected, muscle wasting in mice nevertheless persists. Strikingly, cisplatinalone was seen to regulate muscle atrophy, which was independent of the commonlyimplicated ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, we show that cisplatin is ableto induce NF-κB activity in both mouse muscles and myotube cultures, suggestingthat an additional side effect of cancer treatment is the regulation of musclewasting that may be mediated through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway."

While tobacco andalcohol use may be less likely to cause these tumors, it remains controversialwhether differences also exist in their prognosis. Our aim is to examine the riskfactors for cancer among young (< years old) OTSCC patients at our institution,and to compare their recurrence and survival with older patients in a matchedcohort.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All OTSCC patients seen at our institution between and  were reviewed. Patients under  who with sufficient treatmentinformation were matched : on race, T-stage, and N-stage with patients  andolder. Three-year recurrence and survival were determined in stratified andadjusted Cox regression models.RESULTS: Of  OTSCC patients were seen at our institution,  (%) were lessthan  years old. Younger patients were significantly more likely to be female,(% vs. %; p = .) and to abstain from tobacco (% vs. %; p < .).Young patients in the matched cohort were significantly more likely to have arecurrence (HR . % CI .-.). There was no difference in overall survival.CONCLUSION: Younger OTSCC patients in a matched cohort were more likely to recurwithin  years, although there was no difference in overall mortality.Differences in risk factors and recurrence between older and younger patientssuggest that some cancer among younger patients may be distinct from traditionalOTSCC."

This study examines the cost of providing comprehensivecancer care at the Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence (BCCOE) in Rwanda.METHODS: A retrospective costing analysis was conducted from the providerperspective by using secondary data from the administrative systems of the BCCOE.We identified the start-up funds necessary to begin initial implementation anddetermined the fiscal year - operating cost of the cancer program,including capital expenditures and fixed and variable costs.RESULTS: A total of $, US dollars was assessed as necessary start-upfunding to implement the program. The annual operating cost of the cancer programwas found to be $, US dollars. Radiotherapy, labor, and chemotherapy werethe most significant cost drivers. Radiotherapy services, which require sendingpatients out of country because there are no radiation units in Rwanda, comprised% of program costs, labor accounted for %, and chemotherapy, supportivemedications, and consumables accounted for %. Overhead, training, computedtomography scans, surgeries, blood products, pathology, and social servicesaccounted for less than % of the total.CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to examine operating costs forimplementing a cancer center in a low-income country. Having a strong commitmentto cancer care, adapting clinical protocols to the local setting, shifting tasks,and creating collaborative partnerships make it possible for BCCOE to providequality cancer care at a fraction of the cost seen in middle- and high-incomecountries, which has saved many lives and improved survival.

This study examines the cost of providing comprehensivecancer care at the Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence (BCCOE) in Rwanda.METHODS: A retrospective costing analysis was conducted from the providerperspective by using secondary data from the administrative systems of the BCCOE.We identified the start-up funds necessary to begin initial implementation anddetermined the fiscal year - operating cost of the cancer program,including capital expenditures and fixed and variable costs.RESULTS: A total of $, US dollars was assessed as necessary start-upfunding to implement the program. The annual operating cost of the cancer programwas found to be $, US dollars. Radiotherapy, labor, and chemotherapy werethe most significant cost drivers. Radiotherapy services, which require sendingpatients out of country because there are no radiation units in Rwanda, comprised% of program costs, labor accounted for %, and chemotherapy, supportivemedications, and consumables accounted for %. Overhead, training, computedtomography scans, surgeries, blood products, pathology, and social servicesaccounted for less than % of the total.CONCLUSION: This study is one of the first to examine operating costs forimplementing a cancer center in a low-income country. Having a strong commitmentto cancer care, adapting clinical protocols to the local setting, shifting tasks,and creating collaborative partnerships make it possible for BCCOE to providequality cancer care at a fraction of the cost seen in middle- and high-incomecountries, which has saved many lives and improved survival. Not all therapies,though, were available because of limited financial resources."
" Dana-Farber Cancer Institute","TP protein levels, RNA-based pathway assessment, and race among invasive breastcancer cases.","Mutations in tumor suppressor TP have been inconsistently linked to breastcancer risk factors and survival. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, a primaryclinical means of TP mutation determination, only detects mutations thatfacilitate protein accumulation (e.g., missense mutations). RNA-based pathwaymethods capture functional status and may aid in understanding the role of TPfunction in racial disparities of breast cancer. TP status was assessed amonginvasive breast cancer cases from the Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS)(-) using IHC and an established RNA-based TP signature (CBCS and TheCancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)). Frequency of TP status (IHC, RNA-based) wasestimated in association with tumor characteristics, PAM intrinsic subtype,age, and race using relative frequency differences (RFDs) and % confidenceintervals (% CI) as the measure of association. Approximately % of basal-liketumors were TP protein positive (IHC), while nearly % were TP mutant-like(RNA). Luminal A tumors had low frequency of TP positivity (IHC: .%) andmutant-like status (RNA: .%). Mutant-like TP (RNA) was strongly associatedwith age ≤ years, high tumor grade, advanced stage of disease, large tumorsize, and basal-like and HER intrinsic subtypes. Black race was stronglyassociated with TP mutant-like status (RNA) (RFD: .%, % CI: ., .)even after adjusting for age, grade, stage (RFD: .%; % CI: ., .).Associations were attenuated and non-significant when measured by IHC. IHC-basedTP status is an insensitive measurement of TP functional status. RNA-basedmethods suggest a role for TP in tumor prognostic features and racialdisparities."

All scans were reviewedby a dedicated neuroradiologist with subspecialty expertise in head and neckimaging. Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion to the genioglossus,hyoglossus, medial pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles was analyzed. Local andregional recurrence rates were compared between the muscle invasion and no muscleinvasion groups.RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients met inclusion criteria with adequatefollow-up data and pretreatment imaging. Patients were predominantly male (.%male) and smokers (.% smokers) with a mean age of . (standard deviation:. years). Most commonly invaded muscles in the muscle invasion group werehyoglossus (.%) and genioglossus (.%). There was no statisticallysignificant difference in primary site or nodal recurrence between the combinedgroup, including definite or possible muscle invasion and the group withoutmuscle invasion (P = . and P = ., respectively). Additionally, nostatistically significant difference was present in recurrence-free anddisease-specific survival between the two groups at - and -year follow-up(P > .).CONCLUSION: Radiographic evidence of muscle invasion does not appear to be apredictor of human papilloma virus (+) OPSCC recurrence.

" University of Texas Health Sciences Centerat San Antonio","Use of lung treatment plans to evaluate DIR algorithms.","The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of two deformable imageregistration algorithms by examining their influence on the dose summationresults obtained using DCT (four dimensional computed tomography) dosedistributions based on 'D' planned and 'D optimal' IMRT (intensity modulatedradiation therapy) plans. For ten lung cancer patients, D step and shoot IMRTplans were produced. The breathing cycle was divided into ten parts and for eachpart a set of CT images was acquired. For each patient the treatment plan wascopied to the CTs of each phase and subsequently recalculated. Each phase CT wasthen registered to the average intensity projection (AIP) CT using a deformableimage registration (DIR) algorithm and the composite dose distribution was thencalculated by summing up the deformed dose distributions from all the phases('D' treatment plan). The 'D optimal' treatment plan was created by producingan optimal plan on the CTs of each phase of the respiratory cycle and summing upthe deformed dose distributions from all the phases. The results indicate that itis possible to map the dose distributions of different breathing phases in lungusing DIR, and that different DIR methods and target characteristics (motionamplitude, size, location) affect the differences between original plan, 'D' and'D optimal' dose distributions. Although the 'D optimal' plans were designed toachieve % target coverage, both of the used DIR methods failed to translatethat coverage in some instances. The same variation between these methods wasalso observed in the 'D' plan comparison. This study shows that it is feasibleto perform an acceptably accurate calculation of the composite deformed dose.However, it is important to account for tumor motion and body deformationespecially when the tumor volume is small and/or located in the lower lobe of thelung."

"American Institutes for Research","Mental status evaluation in older adults with cancer: Development of the MentalHealth Index-.","OBJECTIVES: The Mental Health Index (MHI) is widely used as a measure of mentalhealth status, but has not been evaluated in the geriatric oncology population.This study evaluated the MHI- in a geriatric oncology population, to establishvalidity and scoring rules.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Carolina Senior Registry (NCT) was used toobtain data for  patients with cancer  and older who completed the MHI-.The -item patient-reported measure produces one total score summing across fourdomains: anxiety, depression, positive affect, and sense of belonging. Cronbach'salpha (α), confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), item-response theory (IRT)analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses were used to evaluateinternal consistency and validity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The revised MHI retained the  best-fitting items fromthe MHI- and resulted in a final model that included two subscales: anxiety(four items, RMSEA .; CFI .; TLI .) and depression ( items, RMSEA .;CFI .; TL .). IRT analyses of the four anxiety items indicated good fit(RMSEA .) and precise measurement of adults with poor mental health, and thenine depression items also fit well (RMSEA .). No meaningful differences werefound by sex, education, or treatment stage. Scores were developed to providemeaningful norms. The new MHI- is a shorter, more accurate way to assess mentalhealth in older adults with cancer and most importantly allows clinicians toseparately identify anxiety and/or depression - a clinically importantdistinction as treatment differs among these two types of mental healthimpairment."
" Shanghai Jiao Tong University","Overall survival time prediction for high-grade glioma patients based onlarge-scale brain functional networks.","High-grade glioma (HGG) is a lethal cancer with poor outcome. Accuratepreoperative overall survival (OS) time prediction for HGG patients is crucialfor treatment planning. Traditional presurgical and noninvasive OS predictionstudies have used radiomics features at the local lesion area based on themagnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the highly complex lesion MRIappearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurateindividualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namelybrain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-statefunctional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional networkswhere the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesionappearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics featurescould capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated withprognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse representation withregional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional connectivity (FC) networks(characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamicsFC time courses). Then, we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networksfor a jointly, machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on apreliminary dataset (N =  with bad OS, mean OS, ~ days; N =  with good OS,mean OS, ~ days), we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy (.%) onseparating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS. However, if usingonly conventionally derived descriptive features (e.g., age and tumorcharacteristics), the accuracy is low (.%). Our study highlights theimportance of the rs-fMRI and brain functional connectomics for treatmentplanning."

However, the highly complex lesion MRIappearance may have large individual variability, which could impede accurateindividualized OS prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, namelybrain connectomics-based OS prediction. It is based on presurgical resting-statefunctional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the non-local, large-scale brain functional networkswhere the global and systemic prognostic features rather than the local lesionappearance are used to predict OS. We propose that the connectomics featurescould capture tumor-induced network-level alterations that are associated withprognosis. We construct both low-order (by means of sparse representation withregional rs-fMRI signals) and high-order functional connectivity (FC) networks(characterizing more complex multi-regional relationship by synchronized dynamicsFC time courses). Then, we conduct a graph-theoretic analysis on both networksfor a jointly, machine-learning-based individualized OS prediction. Based on apreliminary dataset (N =  with bad OS, mean OS, ~ days; N =  with good OS,mean OS, ~ days), we achieve a promising OS prediction accuracy (.%) onseparating the individuals with bad OS from those with good OS.

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was used to study theefflux of d-luciferin potassium salt, the substrate of ATP-binding cassettetransporters (ABC transporters), in MCF-/DOX cells treated by β-ELE. At the sametime three major ABC transport proteins and genes-related MDR, P-glycoprotein(P-gp, ABCB) and multidrug resistance-associated protein  (MRP, ABCC) as wellas breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG) were analyzed by q-PCR andWestern blot. To investigate the efflux functionality of ABC transporters,MCF-/DOXFluc cell line with stably-overexpressed luciferase was established. BLIwas then used to real-time monitor the efflux kinetics of d-luciferin potassiumsalt before and after MCF-/DOXFluc cells being treated with β-ELE or not. Theresults showed that the efflux of d-luciferin potassium salt from MCF-/DOXFlucwas lessened when pretreated with β-ELE, which means that β-ELE may dampen thefunctionality of ABC transporters, thus decrease the efflux of d-fluoresceinpotassium or other chemotherapies which also serve as the substrates of ABCtransporters. As the effect of β-ELE on the expression of ABC transporters, theresults of q-PCR and Western blot showed that gene and protein expression of ABCtransporters such as P-gp, MRP, and BCRP were down-regulated after the treatmentof β-ELE. To verify the efficacy of β-ELE on reversing MDR, MCF-/DOX cells weretreated with the combination of DOX and β-ELE. MTT assay showed that β-ELEincreased the inhibitory effect of DOX on the proliferation of MCF-/DOX, and theIC of the combination group was much lower than that of the single DOX or β-ELEtreatment. In all, β-ELE may reverse MDR through the substrates of ABCtransporters by two ways, to lessen the ABC protein efflux by weakening theirfunctionality, or to reduce the quantity of ABC gene and protein expression."

Compared with men of other races andethnicities, African-American men have higher rates of mortality and morbidityfrom chronic illness and diseases including cancer, heart disease, prostatecancer, diabetes and HIV/AIDS. One way to address these disparities is to includeAfrican-American men in health research, to elicit their perspectives on healthrisks and protective factors. These can then inform interventions aimed atreducing health disparities. However, challenges remain in recruiting andengaging African-American men in health research.AIM: To provide strategies for recruiting African-American men in healthresearch, using as an exemplar a qualitative study of fathers' perspectives ofsexual health promotion with young African-American males.DISCUSSION: Efforts are needed to increase the representation of African-Americanmen in health research. Ensuring that researchers are aware of the cultural,social and environmental factors related to decisions to participate in researchcan lead to effective methods to recruit and engage them.CONCLUSION: There are several essential strategies for increasingAfrican-American men's participation in health research: ensuring the researchteam is culturally and gender-sensitive; recruiting in trusted environments;using respected gatekeepers; developing trust with participants; and beingtransparent.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Implementing strategies to include African-Americanmen in health research has the potential to improve health disparities in the US."

However, it is unclear whether surveillance increases survivaltimes of patients with BE. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis toqualitatively and quantitatively examine evidence for the association ofendoscopic surveillance in patients with BE with survival and other outcomes.METHODS: We searched publication databases for studies reporting the effects ofendoscopic surveillance on mortality and other EAC-related outcomes. We reviewedrandomized controlled trials, case-control studies, studies comparing patientswith BE who received regular surveillance with those who did not receive regularsurveillance, and studies comparing outcomes of patients withsurveillance-detected EAC vs symptom-detected EACs. We performed a meta-analysisof surveillance studies to generate summary estimates using a random effectsmodel. The primary aim was to examine the association of BE surveillance onEAC-related mortality. Secondary aims were to examine the association of BEsurveillance with all-cause mortality and EAC stage at time of diagnosis.RESULTS: A single case-control study did not show any association betweensurveillance and EAC-related mortality. A meta-analysis of  cohort studies foundthat lower EAC-related and all-cause mortality were associated with regularsurveillance (relative risk, .; % CI, .-.; hazard ratio, .; % CI,.-.).

" Federal University of Sao Paulo","Antireflux Surgery and Barrett's Esophagus: Myth or Reality?","BACKGROUND: It may seem questionable if antireflux surgery still has a role inthe management of patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) in the current era whenantireflux surgery is facing a steady decline, obesity is increasing,pharmacologic treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is in itssplendor, and endoscopic techniques are used more frequently. It is questionableif patients with BE should be operated to stop GERD and to prevent cancer. Theaim of this study was to determine the role of antireflux surgery in patientswith BE.METHODS: Literature review.RESULTS: The role of antireflux operations is, in fact, very controversial andneglected. BE is a different phenotype of GERD with a distinct pathophysiologylinked to severe reflux of bile and acid, due to a marked anatomic disruption ofthe gastroesophageal barrier. Published series show that a fundoplicationadequately controls GERD and symptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or evenbetter a bile diversion antireflux procedure) may prevent esophagealadenocarcinoma.CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a fundoplication efficiently controls GERD andsymptoms in BE patients. A fundoplication (or even better a bile diversionprocedure) may also prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma."

The Parent Caring Response Scoring System derived fromSwanson's Caring Theory was used to code parent communication behaviors as caringresponses during their children's port starts. Three - to -minute slices(pre-port start, during, and post-port start) were coded for each video. Mixedmodeling with generalized estimating equations and Friedman test were used toanalyze longitudinal change in parent behaviors.RESULTS: Significant differences were found between T versus T in eye contact(β = -., p = .), distance-close-enough-to-touch (β = -., p = .),nonverbal comforting (β = -., p = .), and availability (β = -., p =.), suggesting that more parents used communication behaviors at T comparedwith T. Parent burdensome or intrusive questions (e.g., Why do you cry? β =-., p = .) and nonverbal comforting (β = -., p = .) increased from Tto T. The median values of parent communication behaviors overall had nosignificant changes from T to T.CONCLUSION: Parents adjusted to use more nonverbal caring behaviors as theirchild experienced additional port starts. Experimental studies should be designedto help parents use caring behaviors to better support their children duringcancer procedures."

" Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","Tuning Parameter Selection in Cox Proportional Hazards Model with a DivergingNumber of Parameters.","Regularized variable selection is a powerful tool for identifying the trueregression model from a large number of candidates by applying penalties to theobjective functions. The penalty functions typically involve a tuning parameterthat control the complexity of the selected model. The ability of the regularizedvariable selection methods to identify the true model critically depends on thecorrect choice of the tuning parameter. In this study we develop a consistenttuning parameter selection method for regularized Cox's proportional hazardsmodel with a diverging number of parameters. The tuning parameter is selected byminimizing the generalized information criterion. We prove that, for any penaltythat possesses the oracle property, the proposed tuning parameter selectionmethod identifies the true model with probability approaching one as sample sizeincreases. Its finite sample performance is evaluated by simulations. Itspractical use is demonstrated in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancerdata."
