" Oslo University Hospital","Phase I study of BNCP, carboplatin and gemcitabine in partiallyplatinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients in first or second relapse(ANZGOG-).","PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the recommendeddose of the vascular disrupting agent, BNCP, in combination with gemcitabineand carboplatin in patients with ovarian cancer in first or second relapse with aminimum  month progression-free interval after last platinum.METHODS: Patients received carboplatin AUC on day  in combination withescalating doses of  or  mg/m gemcitabine on days  and  and escalatingdoses of  or  mg/m BNCP on days  and  every  days for a maximum forsix cycles. Maintenance treatment with  mg/m BNCP treatment continued for amaximum of six additional cycles. Patients were followed for safety andanti-tumor activity.RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. Adverse events were mostcommonly of hematological origin. Dose-limiting toxicities (thrombocytopenia andneutropenia) occurred in two patients at the dose level of  mg/m gemcitabine,carboplatin AUC and  mg/m BNCP. No dose-limiting toxicities were observedat a dose level of gemcitabine  mg/m, carboplatin AUC and BNCP  mg/m.BNCP as a single agent was well tolerated at a dose of  mg/m in maintenancetreatment. Ten patients (%) achieved a complete or partial response accordingto CA and/or RECIST response criteria, four of  (%) responded by RECISTalone. The median progression-free survival was . months.CONCLUSIONS: We have established that BNCP  mg/m with gemcitabine mg/m and carboplatin AUC is the recommended dose level and has anacceptable toxicity profile. Further exploration of BNCP in the ovarian cancersetting is planned."
